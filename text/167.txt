THE BELL WITCH. 153
day to drive away stock and see that the fences
were up. There were three large dogs on the
place that the boy always carried alung, and he
had them well trained and always eager for a
chase, and would start at his call, yelping furi-
ously. Harry was nowhere about. He was out
on the farm with the other hands. But instantly
after Kate spoke Harry’s voice was heard in the
front yard calling the dogs, “Here Cesar, here
Tige, here Bulger, here, here, sic, sic,” slapping
his hands. Not a soul but the Shakers coming
down the lane could be seen. The dogs, however,
responded with savage yelping, going in a fury,
following the voice that led the way aging them
on, and just as the Shakers were nearing the turn-
ing in gate, the dogs leaped the fence at their
horses’ heels, and Harry’s voice was there too,
hollering, “Sic, sic, take ’em.” The Shakers put
whip to their horses and the dogs after them, and
Kate vehemently aging the dogs on and hilari-
ously enjoying the sport. It was a lively chase,
and broke the Shakers from coming that way
again. The witch enjoyed the sport greatly,
laughing and repeating the affair to visitors, in-
jecting many funny expressions in describing the
chase, and how the Shakers held on to their big
hats.
