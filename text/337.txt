THE BELL WITCH. Ed
Betsy Bell’s lover, and of course I want to read
your history. Truly, as you say, it is the most
wonderful phenomenon that ever occurred in this
or any other country, and which will no doubt
ever remain a mystery. I can recall, perhaps, an
hundred occasions since I was a boy that I heard
Uncle Joshua relating the remarkable story, and
strange to say, in the latter years of his life, he
was loth to speak of it, even when urged to re-
count the queer doings and sayings of the witch,
and then, if one of his hearers manifested the
least inclination to disbelieve, he would desist.
He believed in it as strong as he held to his reli-
gion, and a more devoted conscientious Christian
man never lived than Joshua Gardner. He died
a few years since at the age of eighty-four years.
I remember that Uncle Joshua received a copy of
the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post of 1849,
containing a long and interesting account of the
witch, written by a reporter. We kept.the paper
until a few years since, but it has in some way
been lost and cannot now be found. I under-
stand that Mrs. Wade, living near here, who is
now ninety years of age, was a witness to the
stirring and exciting incidents. There are several
persons in this vicinity who are familiar with the
history of the witch, and agree perfectly as to the
facts of the remarkable phenomenon.
Respectfully, W. H. GARDNER.
Drespen, TENN., April 25, 1894.
M. V. Ingram—Dear Sir:
I see notice of your intention to publish a his-
tory of the “Bell Witch.” My uncle, Joshua
