Queen of the Haunted Dell.
‘Mid woodland bowers, grassy dell,

By an enchanted murmuring stream,
Dwelt pretty blue-eyed Betsy Bell,

Sweetly thrilled with love’s young dream.
Life was like the magic spell,

That guides a laughing stream,
Sunbeams glimmering on her fell,

Kissed by lunar’s silvery gleam.
But elfin phantoms cursed the dell,

And sylvan witches all unseen,
As our tale will truly tell,

Wielded sceptre o’er the queen.
