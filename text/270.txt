240 THE BELL WITCH.

order of things is attributed to the witch. It has
not been long since a man claiming to be the
witch was waylayed and murdered by two men
who were cleared on the plea that the murdered
man had bewitehed them.”

“Mother was very intimate with Betsy Bell,”
coutinued Mrs. Rawls, “and sympathized deeply
with berin the trouble and affliction brought
upon her by the wicked thing. It not only pun-
ished her severely, but frightened the poor girl
almost out of her Hfe, and mother stayed with
her the more on this aceount to relieve her fears;
in fact, her parents were afraid to leave her in her
room alone a single night, and mother stayed
with her almost every night, except when Becky
Porter was there. It was very cruel in some
people, she said, to charge the awful thing against
Betsy. She was only twelve or thirteen vears of
age when the demonstrations commenced. She
was a very tender, sweet girl, and was constantly
under the gentle watch care of her mother, and
never had an opportunity or any chance to learn
such an art, if it were possible, and it was not in
her nature to do so, nor could she haye possibly
escaped detection. Those who accused her could
never state a reason or offer a shadow of evidence
to that effect. The persecutions of the witch were
enough for any frail mortal to bear, (more than
her father could bear) without the slanderous
charges of ignorent men who were incapable of
discerning the cause, to crush her hope in life.”
Mrs. Rawls, did you ever hear your mother state
in what particular way the witch annoyed Betsy?
