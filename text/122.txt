voice, and in this way it progressed, developing
until the whistling sound was changed to a weak
faltering whisper uttering indistinct words. The
voice, however, gradually gained strength in
articulating, and soon the utterances became dis-
tinct in a low whisper, so as to be understood in
the absence of any other noise. I do not remem-
ber the first intelligent utterance, which, however,
was of no significance, but the voice soon devel-
oped sufficient strength to be distinctly heard by
every one in the room.
