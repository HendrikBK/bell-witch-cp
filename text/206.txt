place, and detailed events that were then occur-
ing or had just transpired in different localities.
Moreover the visitation entailed great sacrifice.
As to how long this palavering phenomenon con-
tinued in the vicinity, I am unable to state. It
did not disturb the remaining members of the
family at the old place any more. Mother died
shortly after this and the house was entirely
deserted, the Jand and other property being
divided among the heirs. The old house stood
for some years and was used for storing grain
and other farm products, and was finally torn
down and moved away. Many persons professed
to have seen sights and heard strange sounds
about the old house and in the vicinity all along
up to this day. Several have described to me
flitting lights along the old lane and through the
farm, while others profess to have heard sounds
of wonderfully sweet music and strange voices
ullering indistinct words. And it is said that
such things have been seen and heard at various
places in the neighborhood, but F have no per-
sonal knowledge of the facts.
