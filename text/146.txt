134 THE BELL WITCH.

peacemaker, denouncing the others with vehe-
mence and scurrility, uttering bitter curses and
threats of murder unless the beligerents should
desist and behave themselves, and sometimes
would apparently thrash Jerusalem unmercifully
for disobeying orders. These carousals were ended
only by the command of Blackdog, professedly
sending the family away on different errands of
deviltry, one or two remaining to keep up the
usual disturbance in different rooms at the same
time. On one occasion all four appeared almost
beastly drunk, talking in a maudlin sentimental
strain, fuming the house with the scent of whis-
key. Blackdog said they got the whiskey at John
Gardner’s still house, which was some four miles
distant. At other times the unity appeared more
civil, and would treat our company to some de-
lightful singing, a regular concert of rich feminine
voices, modulated to the sweetest cadence and
intonation, singing any hymn called for with
solemnity and wonderful effect. The carousals
did not continue long, much to the gratification
of the family and friends, and our serious appre-
hensions were relieved. These concerts were
agreeable closing exercises of this series of meet-
ings, and after they were suspended the four
demons or unity never, apparently, met again.
