forbodings and dreadful apprehension that the
witch would visit some calamity on him. He
charged every strange noise and occurrence to the
haunt, reciting mysterious occurrences to his
friends, believing that the spirit was ever present
about his premises, and through fear he kept
some man employed on the place to keep him
company.

Richard Williams Bell settled on his portion
of the land inherited from his father’s estate,
buying other interests, and devoted himself to
agriculture. He was endowed with a strong in-
tellect, and was the most cultured of the family,
noted for his splendid business qualifications and
frugality, and especially was he distinguished for
his integrity of character, his deep piety and
devotion to his religious principles, his tender
nature, and promptness in lending a helping hand
where help was needed. He was one of nature’s
noblemen—a good man and valuable citizen.
He had not an enemy in the broad land. His
neighbors trusted him implicitly, and relied upon
him as a true friend and safe counselor in all
things, and his name is cherished to this day by
all who knew him.
