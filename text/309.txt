THE BELL WITCH. 279
thing that was going on in the country, seemed
familiar with everybody’s business, telling things
that no one present knew anything about, called
strangers by name and telling where they were
from before they could introduce themselves. It
would also quote Scripture, discuss doctrinal
questions, sing songs, and pray eloquent prayers,
and never failed to answer any question concern-
ing any passage, verse or text in the Bible cor-
rectly, giving full references as to where it might
be found. Then on the other hand it could be
very wicked and out curse a sailor. Mr. Bell
sometimes sent for father to set up and entertain
Kate, that the family might get a little rest. He
rather liked this, as it afforded him a better oppor-
tunity for prosecuting his investigations. The
witch also seemed to like gossipping with him,
and there was a peculiar excitement about it that
interested him, and he would sit and talk to the
thing just as patiently and earnestly as if he was
discussing a very important matter with some
person. Father said that one night after the
witch had gone on for some time prattling about
everything in the country, he concluded to change
the topic and lead it out concerning itself, and
beginning with flattery he said, ‘Kate, I love to
talk with you because you are so smart and can
always learn me something. You and I have
been good friends, and I want to know more
about you. Now there is no person present but
you and I; tell me confidentially something about
yourself?’ ‘No Jack,’ was the reply, ‘I can’t tell
you that yet, but I will tell you before I leave.’
