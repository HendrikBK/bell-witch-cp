THE BELL WITCH. 259
ing but old Caesar lapping out of the bath tub.”
Old Cesar was the dog. I heard a good deal of
laugh about a trick it played on Drew Bell. Drew
leaned his chair back against the bureau, which
set against the wall, placing his feet on the rounds.
Instantly the bureau was snatched trom behind
him and Drew tumbled down on the floor. The
witch told him to get up, that he ought to have
better sense than lean against the bureau. On
one occasion a little unknown black dog came to
the house, cutting some antics. Mr. Bell said he
would shoot that dog, and started to get his gun.
Mrs. Bell interfered, telling him he must not.
The dog lay down on the floor and rolled over
and over toward the door, and the minute the
dog disappeared from the house the witch ex-
claimed, ‘Look out, Old Jack, here comes Jerusa-
lem.’”

Did you know Rev. Thomas and Rev. James
Gunn, Mrs. Darden? “Indeed I did. They were
the founders of Methodism in this community.
Two nobler ministers never lived in this section,
and I have never seen two men imbued with
more spirituality, and have never heard any
preacher with more inspiration. They preached
all over the country for many miles around, after
going a whole day’s journey or more, and great
revivals resulted from their preaching.”

Did they visit Mr. Bell’s or try to detect the
witch? “My understanding was at the time that
they did. Mr. Bell sent for them often, and they
tried faithfully to throw some light upon the
mystery, but never could.”
