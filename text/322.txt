E. Newton Knew the Men.

Mr. E. Newton, an old and respected citizen of
Cedar Hill, writes under date of Dec. 23, 1891:

I was personally acquainted with Rev. Thomas
Gunn, Rev. James Gunn, William Porter, John
Johnson, Calvin Johnson, Alexander Gunn, and
‘the Bell family. They were of the best families
that ever lived in this country, men of the highest
integrity, and were honored by all people. They
were among the pioners of civilization and Chris-
tianity, and were the leaders in the develupment
of the county. They molded the character of the
best element now in this section, and their influ-
ence will live to affect generations to come. No
men contributed more to the advancement of
Christianity than the two Gunns, E. Newron.
