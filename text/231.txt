THE BELL WITCH. 207
Passing under Uncle Zeke’s tackle, the big swim-
mer flounced again to the top, making a hurry-
skurry circle, tangling the old darkies’ lines with
the pole, and taking another straight shoot up
the river. Before Uncle Zeke could recover
from the confusion, one of his poles had joined in
the procession, and he was bewildered with ex-
citement. “Why don’t you jump in, Uncle Zeke,
and catch that fish and save your pole? Don’t
you see the fish is hung, and you are a good
swimmer? Go quick, jump, plunge, and bring
in the biggest fish ever caught in Red River,”
wildly shouted Frank Miles. This speech fired
Uncle Zeke’s courage to the highest pitch. He
lost his head, and forgot all about the “Injun”
spirit for the moment, and in less than a half
minute had pulled off his coat and shoes and was
in the act of jumping head-foremost into the
river. But a precaution struck him, and he
called a halt, carefully stepping one foot in the
water, which he quickly jerked back with a
shudder, and exclaiming, “I aint gwine dar; Ize
done had er sentment bout dat fish, cepen hits
gwinter fool me.’ “Oh go ahead, Uncle Zeke,
don’t be so cowardly; you belong to Parson Gunn,
and what’s the difference if you shou:d drown,
you will go straight to heaven,” urged Mr. Miles.
