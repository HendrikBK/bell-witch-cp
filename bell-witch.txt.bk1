Queen of the Haunted Dell.

*
'Mid woodland bowers, grassy dell,
  By an enchanted murmuring stream,
Dwelt pretty blue-eyed Betsy Bell,
  Sweetly thrilled with love's young dream.

Life was like the magic spell,
  That guides a laughing stream,
Sunbeams glimmering on her fell,
  Kissed by lunar's silvery gleam.

But elfin phantoms cursed the dell,
  And sylvan witches all unseen,
As our tale will truly tell,
  Wielded sceptre o'er the queen.

PREFACE.

It is not the purpose of the writer to present a
romance for the entertainment of lovers of fiction,
nor to establish a theory to please the fancy of
adherents of so-called theosophy, but simply to
record events of historical fact, sustained by a
powerful array of incontrovertible evidence, as it
comes to hand, testifying to the most wonderful
phenomenon the world has any account of: a
visitation known as the "Bell Witch," believed
at the time by many to have been of supernatural
origin; which appeared in Robertson county,
Tennessee, some seventy-five years ago, inflicting
unendurable suffering on John Bell, the head of
the family, and was said to have ended his life,
and which also awakened a sensation that has
lived through a generation. The writer is aware
of the fact that the average person of to-day eschews
the belief in the existence of witches, ghosts, and
apparitions, as a relic of past superstition, and as
a subject for ridicule; nevertheless, spectres stalk
the earth to-day just as they did hundreds of
-----File: 008.png---------------------------------------------------------
years ago, the only difference being that we now
place a different interpretation upon them, calling
them spirits, fantasies, psychic manifestations,
<span class="abbr">etc.</span>, instead of ghosts and witches, and people
who laugh at the superstition of our fathers only
need be put to the test to prove this fact. However,
this is not the place for moralizing, nor will
the writer find any occasion for drawing on his
imagination for a vivid description of goblins
and devils incarnate, or for painting the revelry
of unknown demons on a mission of torment, to
make the hair stand on one's head, or cause the
unregenerated to shun neglected grave yards.
This part of the story is told by others who mingled
with the familiar spirits, held conversation
with the invisible, took part in their worship.
participated in the ghost dances and midnight
revelries, held councils with the spooks, witnessed
the jack-a-lantern performances, saw unshapely
sights and horrifying transformations, and felt
the warm blood curdle in their veins.

The autnor only assumes to compile the data,
formally presenting the history of this greatest of
all mysteries, just as the matter is furnished to
hand, written by Williams Bell, a member of the
family, some fifty-six years ago, together with
other corroborative testimony by men and women
-----File: 009.png---------------------------------------------------------
of irreproachable character and unquestionable
veracity.

It may be a strange story, nevertheless it is
authentic, not only as recorded by Williams Bell,
but transmitted to the present generation of the
surrounding country through family reminiscences
of that most eventful and exciting period
of the century, which set hundreds of people to
investigating, including <span class="abbr">Gen.</span> Andrew Jackson,
and is recognized in every household as a historical
truth,

No one denies or doubts the existence of witchcraft,
etc., during the dark ages, and it may be
accepted as equally true, that just as enlightened
Christianity has progressed, the deviltry of the
past decades has kept pace with the advancement,
in transformations, assuming other forms and
new channels for mystifying people; such as
spiritual seances, mind reading, hypocrondia,
hypnotism, electrical phenomena, etc.; to satisfy
that innate theosophy of the human family, or
idle desire to comprehend unrevealed mysteries
of God and nature. However this may be, there
igs not one person in a thousand who does not
hold to some kind of superstition, and those most
given to ridiculing the belief in witchcraft of past
ages, believe in omens, prognostics, dreams and

revelations. They carry a rabbit's foot or buck-eye,
keep a horse shoe over or under the door,
see spectres stalking around a table of thirteen, or
could not be induced to start a journey or begin
any work on Friday, and since people of the
present day cannot explain the phenomena in
spiritual manifestations, mind reading, electric
wonders, etc., their ancestors may be excused for
believing in witchcraft, inasmuch as they accepted
the Bible for the guidance of their faith and
believed all it says on this subject, as they did
that pertaining to the soul's salvation, and sought
to put away witchcraft, that Christianity might
prevail. M. V. INGRAM.

THE BELL WITCH.
CHAPTER I.
Introduction.

Before entering upon an investigation, or going
into details of the acts and demonstrations of the
Bell Witch, it is proper that the reader should
know something of the Bell family and citizens
of the community who witnessed the manifesta:
tions, expended their energies in trying to discover
the origin and ferce of the phenomena, and
who in connection with the Bell family, give
credence to the truth of these statements. The
story will not be altogether new to thousands
who have heard graphic accounts from the lips
of the old people who witnessed the excitement
and have, perhaps, also read short newspaper
sketches. No full or authentic account, however,
has ever been published. Newspapers were few
and far between at the time these events tran-*

spired, and there were no enterprising reporters
or novelists abroad in the land. Several writers
in later years undertook to compile the story, but
could not obtain the authentic details. Williams
Bell, it seems, was the only one who kept a diary
of what transpired, which he put in shape in
1846, twenty-six years after the culmination of
the tragical events in the death of John Bell, Sr.
It appears also that he was inspired to write the
sketch by the intensity of the living sensation
that sent a tremor through every nerve of his
body, as it kept fresh in the memory of every
one, the astounding manifestations that continued
to be rehearsed at every fireside and in
every social gathering, taking on new phases and
versions far from the truth. Some enterprising
person, wise in his own conceit, undertook to
solve the mystery, and failing to arrive at any
satisfactory conclusion, gave currency to.a suspision
that the young daughter, Betsy Bell, actuated
by her brothers, John and Drewry, was the author
of the demonstration, and that the purpose was
to make money by the exhibitions. This version
found lodgement in many minds not acquainted
with the facts, and the discussion became very
distasteful and irritating to the family, and WilHams
Bell determined to write the incidents and
-----File: 013.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WITCH. ut
truth of the whole story and let the public pass
upon the injustice ef such a judgment. After it
was written, the brothers consulted over the matter,
and finally for good reasons then existing,
agreed not to publish the statement during the
life of any member of John Bell, Sr.'s immediate
family. Williams Bell died a few years after
this, and gave the manuscript to his eldest son,
James Allen Bell, who has carefully preserved it.
The writer was raised within a few miles of the
Bell place, and has been familiar with the witch
story from his youth up, and becoming intimately
acquainted with Joel and Allen Bell during his
residence in Springfield, about 1867 applied to
Joel Bell for the privilege of writing the history
then, while himself, sister Betsy, Frank Miles,
Lawson Fort, Patrick McGowen, Johnson, and
others acquainted with the facts, were still living.
Joel Bell assented to the proposition, but Allen
Bell declined to furnish his father's manuscript,
and the matter was dropped until recently.
Since the death of all of the family who were
victims of the frightful disturbance, Allen Bell
has consented to the use of his father's statement
in connection with other testimony. The further
explanation of the publication of the history of
these stirring events, after the lapse of many
-----File: 014.png---------------------------------------------------------

years, will be found in the following correspondenee:

ADAIRVILLE, Ky., July Ist, 1891.
M. V. Ingram, Esq., Clarksville, Tenn:

Dear Str--Some years ago, while you were
engaged in publishing a newspaper at Springfield,
Tenn., Uncle Joel Bell applied to me for the
manuscript of my father, Williams Bell, stating
that the application was made at your request for
the purpose of incorporating the same in a full
and complete history of the so-called Bell Witch,
which proposition I declined to accede to at that
time, for several reasons that need not now be
mentioned. However, one objection was, that
after writing his own memories, and the recollections
of other members of the family, father consulted
with Uncle John Bell in regard to the
matter, and they determined that in view of all
the surrounding circumstances, it was best that
it should not be published during the life of any
of Grandfather John Bell's immediate family,
and he gave me all of his notes just before his
death with this injunetion. So many painfully
abhorent misrepresentations had gone out concerning
the mystery that he desired the writing
should be pressrved, that the truth might be
known in after years, should the erroneous views
-----File: 015.png---------------------------------------------------------
which had found lodgement concerning the origin
of the distress continue to live through tradition,
handed down:to an enlighted generation under a
version so disparaging. This history was written
by father during the Fall and Wm.er of 1846,
and is the only sketch ever written in detail by
any one cognizant of the facts and demonstra
tions. Now, nearly seventy-five years having
elapsed, the old members of the.family wha
suffered: the torments having all passed away,
and the witch story still continues to be discussed
us widely as the family name is known. under
misconception of the facts, I have concluded that
in justice to the memory of an honored ancestry,
and to the public also whose minds have been
abused in regard to the matter, it would be well
to give the whole story to the world. You having
made the application years ago, and believing
you are capable, and will if you undertake it,
being already acquainted with many of the circumstances,
compile a faithful history of the
events, 1am willing to let you have this manuscript
and notes, on the condition that you will
agree to include all other corroborative testimony
still to be had, and write a deserved sketch of
Grandfather John Bell and family, and those

associated with him in any way during the period
-----File: 016.png---------------------------------------------------------
of the unexplained visitation which afflicted him
and gave rise to the excitement.
Respectfully, J, A. BELL.
CLARKSVILLE, TENN., July 5th, 1891.
Hon. J. Allen Bell, Adairville, Ky:

Dear Sir--In reply to your favor of the Ist
inst., I remember distinctly the discussion between
Mr. Joel E. Bell and myself in 1867, in
regard to the publication of the history of the
Bell Witch, and also his after report of the interview
with you, which eaused the matter to be
dropped. Joel Bell was a gentleman whom I
esteemed very highly for his moral worth and
generous friendship. His earnestness impressed
me with the views so decidedly expressed in favor
of the publication then, believing the facts would
correct the erroneous impressions which had been
created. I will accept your proposition and
undertake to compile such testimony as may still
exist, as you suggest, and will endeavor to make
a faithful record of the facts. I have always
regarded the so-called Bell Witch as a phenomenon
for which the Bell family, who suffered the
infliction and misfortune, could in no wise be
responsible, but were entitled to all of that sympathy
so generously bestowed by the good people
-----File: 017.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WITCH. pt]
of that community who knew John Bell.only to
honor him. But in undertaking the work, it
shall not be my purpose to account for the series
of dramatic events that so confused and mystified
people at that time, but compile the data and let
readers form their own conclusion. I believe the
publication will do good, not only in correcting a
false impression, but will recount historical events
and facts concerning the most remarkable visitations,
in the early part of the present century,
that ever afflicted any community, giving the
present generation some idea of the grounds for
the superstition that possessed the early settlers
of this country. Very truly, your friend,

M. V. INGRAM.
CHAPTER II.

The Early Settlers--Society and Religion--Kate the
Witch--The Bell Family--The School
Master and Betsy's First Lover.

More than one hundred years ago, the Star of
Empire took its course westward, following the
footprints of the advance guard who had blazed
the way with blood, driving the red man, whose
savagery rendered life unsafe and civilization
impossible, from this great country, then, as now,
-----File: 018.png---------------------------------------------------------
16 THE BELL WITCH.

teeming with possibilities. Couriers carried back
the glad tidings of peace and safety, and a glowing
account of the rich lands, fine forests, great
water courses--rivers, creeks, brooks, and bubpling
springs. In short, the land of milk and
honey had been discovered in Tennessee, then
the far west, and the flow of emigration from
North Carolina, Virginia, and other old States,
became steady and constant, rapidly settling up
the country. They were of the best blood of the
land; men of brawn and brain. They came with
the axe, the hoe, the plow and sickle. They
brought with them their customs and notions of
civilization and Christianity, having the Bible
and the American Constitution for their guide.
Wild speculations and schemes of laying out
great cities and building railroads, had not entered
the dreams of men then. Good lands and farming
was the object, and only young men of musele,
nerve, honesty of purpose, and a courageous disposition
to work, possessed of self-reliance and
frugal habits, were among the immigrants.

In selecting homes, good land, plenty of water
and timber, were most sought after, consequently
the level barren lands were neglected, and the
better settlements formed along the rivers and
creeks, and this accounts for the high character
-----File: 019.png---------------------------------------------------------
and noble citizenship on Red River, and Elk
Fork Creek in Robertson county, where the
scenes described further on occurred.

Along with this tide of immigration came John
Bell and his amiable wife Lucy and family of
promising children, also a number of likely
negroes, then slaves. They landed with their
train of wagons and splendid teams in the west
end of Robertson county, Tennessee, near whero
Adams Station is now located, on the Southeastern
line of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad,
in the year 1804, and met with a hearty
reception by old friends who had preceded them.
There was general rejoicing in the community
over the accession to the quiet, happy neighborhood.
Mr. Bell purchased a home, partially improved,
with good houses, barns, and a fine young
orchard, surrounding himsclf with about one
thousand acres of the best land on Red River,
and settled down for life, clearing more land and
opening a large and fertile farm. His commanding
appearance, steadfast qualities, and force of
character, at once gave him rank and influence
in the community. Mrs. Lucy Bell was an
exemplary mother among matrons, ruling her
children with the glowing passion of a tender
loving mother's heart; even the stern husband
-----File: 020.png---------------------------------------------------------
18 THE BELL WITCH.

yielded to every glance of her gentle piercing
eyes and loving smiles. Everybody was in love
with Mrs. Bell, and wondered at the power of her
influence, and the charming discipline exercised
in her home. Jt was indeed a happy and very
prosperous family, as every one recognized.

The principal families composing this delightful
neighborhood at that time were Rev. James
and Rey. Thomas Gunn, the pioneers of Methodism;
William Johnson and James Johnson, the
founder of Johnson's Camp Ground, and his two
sons, John and Calvin Johnson; John Bell, Jerry
Batts, the Porters, Frederick Batts, the Long
family, James Byrns, the Gardners, Bartletts and
Dardens, the Gooch family, Pitman, Ruffin,
Mathews, Morris, Frank Miles and_ brothers,
"Ninety-Six" Needham, Justice and Chester; and
just across Red River, between that and Elk
Fork Creek, was the large Fort settlement, the
Sugg family, McGowen, Bourne, Royster, Waters,
Thomas Gorbam, Herring, and many other goud
people. Rev. Sugg Fort was a pioneer Baptist
minister and a man of great influence. These
people raised large families, and formed the aristocratic
society of the country, and no man whose
character for morality and integrity was not above
reproach was admitted to the circle. The circle.
-----File: 021.png---------------------------------------------------------
however, widened, extending up and down the
river, and into Kentucky, embracing a large area
of territory. Open hospitality characterized the
community, and neighbors assisted each other
and co-operated in every good move for the
advancement of education and Christianity.
They established schools, built churches and
worshipped together. Churches took the name
of the river, creek or spring of the location, and
it was nothing uncommon for people to go ten or
fifteen miles to church and visiting. The Baptist
took the lead in building houses of worship, Red
River Church being the first established in that
community, which was in 1791. It still maintains
the name and organization under the control
of a new generation, but has changed the
location, moving a short distance to Adams Station,
building a new and more commodious
house. Drake's Pond Church on the State line,
one mile east of Guthrie, Ky., was the next congregation
of worshippers organized. This church
was held by the Predestinarian Baptist when the
split took place in the denomination later. Rev.
Sugg Fort was pastor of both churches, and the
two congregations visited and worshipped with
each other a great deal, the churches being only
seven miles apart. The Methodists, in the mean-*
-----File: 022.png---------------------------------------------------------
20 THE BELL WITCH.

while, established several churches in the circle,
presided over by Rev. James and Rev. Thomas
Gunn, who itinerated a wide scope of country,
evangelizing with great success, and it was not
uncommon for them to travel fifty miles to marry
a couple or preach a funeral. The people of the
Bell neighborhood were about equally divided in
their church affiliations between the Baptist and
Methodist, but toleration, Christian fellowship,
and a spirit of emulation prevailed. They worshipped
together, and the ties of friendship grew
and strengthened; families intermarried, and
these fond relations still exist in the present
generation.

Like all new countries, the settlement became
infested with robbers and horse thieves, and it
was almost impossible for any one to keep a good
horse. It seemed that the legal authorities were
powerless to detect and break up the vandalism
and the situation necessitated some active measures
on the part of the citizens. Nicholas Darnley,
who lived on the Tennessee side of Drake's
Pond, several of the Forts and Gunns, taking the
matter in hand, quietly organized a large vigilance
committee to ferret out such crimes, and
were not long in detecting the criminals. The
ring 'eaders of the band proved to be men con-*
-----File: 023.png---------------------------------------------------------
nected with respectable families; one lived in the
bend of Red River below Port Royal, and the
other a highly connected citizen of Kentucky.
The regulators took the two thieves into the
dense forest and swamps between Drake's Pond
and Sadlersville (as now known), strung them
up to limbs of trees and whipped them from head
to foot with keen switches. The men were then
set free, and warned that if caught again after
three days they would be hung. The thieves
emigrated ut once, crossing the Mississippi River,
and finally settled in Louisiana, reformed, leading
more honorable lives, and soon became extensive
cotton planters and died respected, leaving
handsome fortunes. Both raised large families,
ignorant of this stain, and therefore their names
are prudently withheld from this sketch, but the
circumstance, which was not very uncommon in
olden times, illustrates the fact, that the hickory
used by our fathers was more potent in correcting
bad morals than the penitentiaries of to-day, and
was not less humane. Convicts who darken the
door of a modern prison, suffer the same character
of punishment, laid on with greater brutality, and
other cruelties, and rarely is one ever reclaimed.
Whatever may be said of the barbarity of the old
whipping post law, it was certain punishment
-----File: 024.png---------------------------------------------------------
22 THE BELL WITCH.

for the convicted, and a greater terror to law-breakers,
than the penitentaries of the present
day, and was more effective every way, giving
bad men a chance to reform. No criminal cared
to show his face in the community «fter going to
the whipping post. They invariably moved and
led better lives.

The principal trading points for this locality at
that time were Port Royal, Tenn., and Keysburg,
Ky., the oldest towns in this country, and just as
large then as now; also Adairville, Ky., Springfield,
Clarksville, and Nashville, Tenn. Merchants
bought their goods in Philadelphia and
New Orleans, hauling them out by wagons until
steamboats were brought into use. People, however,
bought but very few goods. They raised
eotton and flax, sheep for wool, and made their
clothing at home, using the hand gin, cards,
spinning wheel, and old-fashioned loom, and had
a cobbler to make up the hides, tanned in a
neighboring tannery on shares, into shoes. Docetors
were scarce in the country, and the few
located at the trading points, did the medical
practice of the entire country, riding from five to
fifteen miles to see patients.

Some twelve years have passed since John Bell
commenced a happy and prosperous career in his
-----File: 025.png---------------------------------------------------------
new home on the south bank of Red River in
Robertson county. A very interesting family of
children have grown up, and fortune has smiled
on him at every turn. He has become one of the
wealthiest and most influential men in the community,
respected for his integrity of character,
Christian devotion and generous hospitality. His
house had become the home of every passing
stranger, and neighbors delighted in frequent calls
and visits. Many were the pleasant social gatherings
at the Bell place, in which Prof. Richard
Powell, the handsome bachelor school teacher,
found pleasurable mingling. He was a man of
culture and force of character, distinguished in
his profession, which was a high calling at that
day and time. Every one liked Dick Powell for
his fine social qualities and genial manners. He
kept a large school in the settlement, and was the
educator of several of Mr. Bell's children, especially
his young daughter Betsy, whom he gave
four years of tuition, and relished every opportunity
for praising her virtues to her mother,
telling Mrs. Bell what a bright, sweet girl she
was, and no one was disposed to controvert his
judgment on this point. Betsy was now ripening
into lovely girlhood, and the lads who had grown
up with her under Richard Powell's tutorship,
-----File: 026.png---------------------------------------------------------
24 THE BELL WITCH.

were as firmly impressed with her charms as was
the teacher. However, the boys were yet a little
shy of any demonstrations giving expression to
their' convictions, as Betsy was considered too
young to receive the attention of beaux, and
bashful youngsters made excuses for calling at
Mr. Bell's to visit his boys. There was one very
gallant youth, however, who made no effort to
disguise his admiration for the blue-eyed beauty,
and his attentions to Betsy were not discouraged.
Jushua Gardner was a very handsome young
man, graceful in appearance and cultured in
manners, and very entertaining socially. He was
of a good family, and had won the distinction of
being the sprightliest youth in school. Every
one conceded that Josh was a line fellow, who
would make his way in the world, and his attentions
to Betsy were not displeasing to the old
folks nor her brothers.

About this time a mysterious visitor, claiming
to hale from the old North State, put in appearance,
taking up headquarters at John Bell's, and
persisted, in spite of opposition, in remaining
indefinitely to fulfill certain missions. This was
"Kate" the witch, which the reader is doubtless
growing very impatient to know something about.

ance of things out of ordinary course of events,
occurred in 1817. Mr. Bell, while walking
through his corn field, was confronted by a strange
animal, unlike any he had ever seen, sitting in a
corn row, gazing steadfastly at him as he approached
nearer. He concluded that it was prohably
a dog, and having his gun in hand, shot at
'it, when the animal ran off. Some days after, in
the late afternoon, Drew Bell observed a very
large fowl, which he supposed to be a wild turkey,
as it perched upon the fence, and ran in the house
for a gun to kill it. As he approached within
shooting distance, the bird flapped its wings and
sailed off, and then he was mystified in discovering
that it was not a turkey, but some unknown
bird of extraordinary size. Betsy walked out
one evening soon after this with the children,
among the big forest trees near the house, and
saw something which she described as a pretty
little girl dressed in green, swinging to a limb of
a tall oak. Then came Dean, the servant, reporting
that a large black dog came in the road in
front of him at a certain place, every night that
he visited his wife Kate, who belonged to Alex.
Gunn; and trotted along before him to the cabin
door and then disappeared.

These strange apparitions, however, passed for

the time unnoticed, exciting no apprehensions
whatever. Very soon there came a_ strange
knocking at the door and on the walls of the
house, which could not be detected. Later on
the disturbance commenced within the house;
first in the room occupied by the boys, and
appeared like rats gnawing the bed posts, then
like dogs fighting, and also a noise like trace
chains dragging over the floor. As svon as a
candle was lighted to investigate the disturbance,
the noise would cease, and screams would be
heard from Betsy's room; something was after
her, and the girl was frightened nearly out of her
life.

Mr. Bell now felt a strange affliction coming
on him, which he could not account for. It was
stiffness of the tongue, which came suddenly, and
for a time, when these spells were on, he could
not eat. He described it as feeling like a small
stick of wood crosswise in his mouth, pressing
out both cheeks, and when he attempted to eat
it would push the victuals out uf his mouth.

John Bell endured such things for a long time,
perhaps a year or more. hoping that the disturbance
would cease, charging his family to keep
the matter a profound secret, and they were loyal
in their obedience. As frightful as were the
-----File: 031.png---------------------------------------------------------
demonstrations, not a single neighbor or friend
outside of the family had any knowledge of the
facts until the affliction became insufferable,
when Mr. Bell, in strict confidence, laid the matter
before James Johnson and wife, narrating the
circumstances, insisting that they should spend a
night at his house, hoping that Mr. Johnson
could throw some light on the mystery. The
wish was very cordially acceded to, and at the
hour of retirement Mr. Johnson led in family
worship, as was his custom,.reading a chapter,
singing a hymn, and then offering prayer. He
prayed very earnestly and fervently for a revelation
of the cause, or that the Lord would remove
the disturbance. As soon as all were in bed and
the lights extinguished, the frightful racket commenced,
and presently entered Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson's room with increased demonstrations,
stripping the cover from their bed. Mr. Johnson
was astounded and sat upright in bed in wild
amazement; but he was a man of strong faith and
cool courage, and recovering from the confusion
he collected his wits and commenced talking to
the spectre, adjuring it to reveal itself and tell for
what purpose it was there. The effect of the
entreaty convinced Mr. Johnson that the demonstrations
came from an intelligent source of some
-----File: 032.png---------------------------------------------------------
28 THE BELL WITCH.

character, but beyond this he had no conception
whatever. He however insisted that Mr. Bell
should let the matter be known, and call in other
friends to assist in the further investigation.
This was agreed to, and there was no end to the
number of visitors and investigations. Kate,
however, developed more rapidly, and soon in
answer to the many entreaties, commenced talking,
and among the first vocal demonstrations,
repeated Mr. Johnson's song and prayer offered
on the night of his first visit, referred to, word
for word, personating the old gentleman, assimilating
his character so perfectly that no one could
distinguish it from his voice and prayer.

Kate had nuw become a fixture, attaining eminence
as chief among citizens, at home in the
excellent family of John Bell, Sr., and distinguished
as the Bell Witch. He, she, or it--whatever
may have been the sex, has never Leen
divined--made great pretentions for religion.
taking Mr. Johnson for a model of Christianity,
calling him "Old Sugar Mouth," frequently observing
"Lord Jesus, how sweet Old Sugar Mouth
prays; how I do love to hear him." Kate delighted
in Scriptural controversies, eould quote
any text or passage in the Bible, and was able to
maintain a discussion with the ablest theolo-*
-----File: 033.png---------------------------------------------------------
gians, excelling in fervency of prayer and devotional
songs--no human voice was so sweet.
Kate made frequent visits to North Carolina,
John Bell's old neighborhood, never absent
longer than a day or an hour, but always reporting
correctly the news or events of the day in
that vicinity. With all of these excellent traits
of character, Kate behaved badly toward visitors
and all members of the family except Mrs. Lucy
Bell, to whom the witch was devoted, declaring
that "Old Luce" was a good woman, but manifesting
very great aversion for "Old Jack"--John
Bell, Sr. He was most detestible and loathsome
in the eyes of Kate, for which no cause was ever
assigned. But the witch often declared its purpose
of killing him before leaving the place.

Kate was also aversed to the growing attachment
between Joshua Gardner and Betsy Bell,
and remonstrated, punishing Betsy severely in
divers ways for receiving his devoted attentions.
Esther, Betsy's older and only sister, married
Bennett Porter, just before the witch had fully
developed, and Betsy was now the pride and pet
of the household. Like all other girls, however,
she made borom companions of two of her female
associates. These were Theny Thorn and Rebeeca
Porter. They were Betsy's seniors by one

or two years, but were both vivacious, charming
girls, and bad many admirers. Becky Porter
was a sister of Bennett Porter, and Theny Thorn
was the adopted daughter of James Johnson and
second wife, also a niece of Mrs. Johnson, who
had no children, and they were greatly devoted
to her. In fact she was petted and almost spoilt.
and knew them only as father and mother. The
three girls were class-mates in school, close neighbors,
the families all on the most intimate terms,
and they grew up together like sisters, almost
inseparably attached to each other, going together
in society, and were the chief attraction for all
the young men in the country. Especially was
young James Long devoted to charming Becky
Porter, and Alex. Gooch felt a strong pulsation
in his heart for lovely Theny Thorn.

Kate the witch never slept, was never idle or
confined to any place, but was here and there and
everywhere, like the mist of night or the morning
sunbeams, was everything and nothing, invisible
yet present, spreading all over the neighborhood,
prying into evervbody's business and domestic
affairs; canght on to every ludicrous thing that
happened, and all of the sordid, avaricious meanness
that transpired; divining the inmost secrets
of the human heart, and withal, was a great blah-*
-----File: 035.png---------------------------------------------------------
mouth; getting neighbors by the ears, taunting
people with their sius and short-comings, and
laughing at their folly in trying to discover the
identity of the mystery. Kate, however, held fast
tu Christianity, and was a regular fire-eating
Methodist while associating with "Old Sugar
Mouth" and his son, Calvin Johnson; was a regular
attendant at Mr. Johnson's prayer meetings,
calling the amens, thumping on the chairs, and
uttering the exclamation "Lord Jesus."

People now concluded that a good spirit had
been sent to the community to work wonders
and prepare the good at heart for the second
advent. Kate's influence was something like that
exercised over a "whiskey-soaked town" by Rev.
Sam Jones at the present day, only more forceful.
The sensation spread hundreds of miles and people
were wild with the excitement, and traveled
long distances on horse back and in vehicles to
witness the demonstrations, and Mr. Bell's home
was continually overflowing with visitors and
investigators. John Bell's hospitality, however,
was equal to the great strain. He fed all visitors
free of charge. Citizens of the community soon
learned to respect Kate's presence and councils,
as they feared and abominated the witch's scorpion
tongue. Everybody got good; the wicked
-----File: 036.png---------------------------------------------------------
32 THE BELL WITCH.

left off swearing, lying and whiskey drinking, just
as people do now for Rev. Sam, Jones. The
avaraicious were careful not to covet or lay hands
on that which belonged to their neighbors, lest
Kate might tell on them. No man allowed his
right hand to do anything that the left might be
ashamed of. No citizen thought of locking his
smoke house or crib door, nor of staying up
through the night to guard his hen roost or
watermellon patch. Negroes were too sleepy to
leave their cabins after night, and white people
went out only in companies after dark to attend
prayer meetings. The wickedest man in the
country could break new ground all day with a
fiery team and kicking colter. singing psalms,
and never think of cursing, though he might be
laid out in a trance a dozen times by a punch
from the frisky plow handles. No incident out
of the regular routine of every day transactions
occurred that the witch did not know all about
the affair, and would tell the circumstance to some
one in less than an hour.

What a great factor in polities this warlock
would be at the present time? The whole country
would vote Kate an honorary life membership
of both houses of Congress, and the right to preside
in all departments at Washington, with the
-----File: 037.png---------------------------------------------------------
privilege of compelling witnesses, books, papers,
and giving reports to the newspapers. The witch
might also spread out over the entire land during
election times to warn the people who was fit for
office. Ifso, only those commended by the mage
would ever attain to office, for no amount of
money could bribe the witch to conceal the
schemes and purposes of designing men. Whatever
else may be said of the Bell Witch, Kate
evinced an exalted opinion and profound respect
for an honest man, and never hesitated, when
occasion seemed to require, to remark the distinction
of character in men, as in the case of the
two brothers, John and Calvin Johnson. John
was pronounced a sly trickster, frank and genial
in his oulward appearance and association, but
secretly planning in his own mind some crafty
scheme to detect the mysterious oracle. Calvin,
however, was an honest man with a pure heart,
free from guile, and he was permitted to feel the
gentle pressure of the seer's velvety hand, which,
when laid on others, produced a smarting sensation,
like the chastising palm of an irate mother
when laid on a disobedient boy. However, this
semblance of deep piety did not hold out. It
answered a good purpose in the prayer meetings,
serving to promote Christian fellowship and unify
-----File: 038.png---------------------------------------------------------
different denominations in devotional exercises,
in alternate meetings at Brother Johnson's (Meth-
'odist), and Brother Bell's (Baptist), but Kate at
last undertook too much for the most renowned
wizard. Satan, it ix said, wax once a respected
angel, and becoming too presuimptious, fell from
his high state, and so from the sane kind of rashness
Kate "tumbled." This came of attending
the preaching of Rev. James Gunn and Rev. Sugg
Fort, thirteen miles apart, on the same day and
same hour, trying to reconcile the 'Arminianism
of the one and Calvinism of the other, mixing
Methodist fire with Baptist water. This was too
much even for so great an oracle as the Bell
Witch. The preachers were all right, and their
sermons and doctrines both good taken one at the
time, and a regencrated person could hardly niisx
heaven on either line, but it would perplex an
angel, much less a presumptuous zealot, to run on
both schedules at the same time. This is what
Kate undertook to do, and suecceded to the extent
of taking in both sermons, but the mixture was
too strong for the witch's faith, and the whole
stock of piety was soon worked of at a discount.
After this Kate backslided and fell from grace,
took up with unregenerated spirits, held high
carnivals at John Gardner's still house, coming

¢
-----File: 039.png---------------------------------------------------------
in very drunk, cursing and fuming, filling the
house with bad breath, spitting on the negroes,
overturning the chairs, stripping the cover from
the beds, pinching and slapping the children, and
teasing Betsy in every conceivable way, and to
such an alarming extent that her parents feared
for her to remain alone in her room a single
night, and when it was not convenient for Theny
Thorn or Rebecca Porter, or both to stay with
her, they sent her from home to spend the night.
This is something of the general character of
Kate, the unknown citizen, which is authentieally
recorded in detail by Williams Bell and
others further on.

CHAPTER [T.

Biographical Sketch of the Bell Family and Reminiscences.

John Bell, Sr., was born in 1750 in Halifax
county, North Carolina. He was a son of William
Bell, a thrifty farmer and prominent citizen.
John was given a good country school education,
and was brought upon the farm, where he acquired
industrious and steady habits in youth,
and grew to manhood noted for his indomitable
-----File: 040.png---------------------------------------------------------
36 THE BELL WITCH.

energy and perseverance, combining all of those
good qualities which fits a man for usefulness and
success in life, conpled with good practical sense
and a keen quick perception. In the meantime
he learned the cooper's business, which was a
valuable trade at that day, and with all he was
a handsome, prepossessing gentleman.

In 1782 John Bell wedded Miss Lucy WilHams,
daughter of John Williams, of Edgecomb
county, North Carolina, a man of considerable
wealth and prominence in the community. Lucey
was a very handsome, winsome lady, possessing
those higher qualities of mind and heart and
grace of manners which go to make up that
lovely female character she developed all through
life, as the reader has already been informed.
John Williams approved the match, and gave his
daughter a young negro woman, Chloe, and her
child, named Dean, and with the means John had
saved up, they bought a farm in Edgecomb
county, beginning a prosperous career. They
both embraced the Baptist faith and became
earnest Christian workers, living up to their religion
through life.

Twenty-two years of prosperity having now
attended the happy union, John Bell and wife
found a large family growing up around them--six
-----File: 041.png---------------------------------------------------------
children had been born to them, and Chloe had
eight, that had become valuable as slavex--a
family of seventeen. There was absolute necessity
for more elbow room; more land to give their
boys a chance in life. Then it was that Mr. Bell
determined to emigrate to Robertson county,
Tenn." settling, as he did, on Red River, some
forty miles north of Nashville, which history the
reader is already familiar with.

At the time the remarkable events in this history
begun, they had nine children, seven sons
and two daughters, Jesse, John, Jr, Drewry,
Benjamin, Esther, Zadok, Elizabeth, Richard
Williams and Joel Egbert. Benjamin died
young; Zadok was educated for the bar, and
became a brilliant lawyer. He settled in Alabama,
and diced in the flush of young manhood,
having a promising future before him. The other
seven lived to mature age, honored and useful
citizens.

John Bell made it a rule to owe no man.
He paid as he went, and accumulated rapidly
from his farm by economy in management.
He was always forehanded, having money ahead,
and was accommodating to his neighbors, who
were not so fortunate. He was as firm in his
convictions as he was dignified in character and
-----File: 042.png---------------------------------------------------------

generous in hospitality, consequently he was a
tower of strength in the community. His sons
and daughters, and the present gencration of
grand children, have been no less honered, and
no family name has made a stronger impress on
that county.

The first marriage in the family was that of
Esther, who wedded Alex. Bennett Porter, July
24th, 1817, Rev. Thomas Gunn officiating at the
altar. Esther was a very prepossessing young
lady, gifted with many graces and charms which
made her attractive. Bennett Porter was also
popular, and the wedding was quite a noted
event. Jesse Bell, the eldest son, married Miss
Martha Gunn, daughter of Rev. Thomas Gunn.
This marriage took place several months later.
Both couples settled in the neighborhood, making
a fair start in life, sharing the confidence and
good will of thecommunity. A year or two after
the death of John Bell, Sr., the two families emigrated
to Penola county, Miss., where they settled
for life and raised large and interesting families,
and have many descendants there at present.
John Bell, Jr., the second son, was said to be the
very image of his father, and developed the old
gentleman's character to a great degree, and was
distinguished for his firmness and stern integ-*

THE BELLE WITCH. a)
rity. He was a successful farmer and a progressive
citizen, and enjoyed the fullest confidence of
the community. He served as magistrate during
a term of years. John Bell, Jr, married Elizabeth
Gunn, daughter of Rev. Thomas Gunn, and
raised an interesting family. He died in 1861,
John, Jr, Drew, and Alex. Gunn engaged in flat-boating
in 1816. They built generally two or
three boats during the Summer season, in Red
River, at Thomas Gorham's, pow known as the
Sugg mill place. The boats were constructed of
rough hewn and sawed timber, and were cabled
to the bank, awaiting the Wm.er or Spring rise
in the water, when they were loaded with all
kinds of produce, tobacco, flour, corn, oats, bacon,
whiskey, dried fruits, butter, turkeys, chiekens,
eggs, etc., and were cut loose on the first current
of sufficient tide to float the crafts out, each
boat having two men ut the oars and the captain
at the stern with one oar, to steer the boat in the
proper current to avoid snags and breakers, as the
craft drifted on with the flow tothe great Father
of Waters, and down to New Orleans, the southern
mart. This was the only way people had at that
time for shipping their produce to market, except
by wagons. It was very slow, but generally sure,
and always got there with the tide that left Red
-----File: 044.png---------------------------------------------------------
40 THE BELL WITCH.

River. Each one of the partners would take
charge of a boat as captain or master, and first
loaded, first off. After arriving at New Orleans,
and selling the cargo, the boats were worthless
except for fuel or second-hand lumber, and they
were sold for what the timber would bring, and
the boatmen made their way home as best they
could, generally walking, and arriving in time to
build more boats for the next season. A bill of
lading for the last one of these trips, still in existence,
was made out to' Alex. Gunn, April, 1818,
for fitty hogsheads of tobacco weighing 64,166
pounds gross, probably not over 52,000 pounds
net. every hogshead rumbered, for which he
brought in returns a draft on a Nashville bank
for $1,000, two hundred pairs of boots, $800, and
$211 in sugarand coffee. This was probably after
paying freight charges, about three cents per
pound, for the tobacco. About this time two
steainboats, the General Green and the General
Robertson, entered the Cumberland River, driving
most of the flat-boatsmen out of the business,
having a monopoly of the shipping trade up to
1822, making Clarksville the principal shipping
point, which was then a town of only forty famiNes---215
white population, and a number of negrocs.
-----File: 045.png---------------------------------------------------------
The want of some satisfactory explanation, or
the failure of all investigations to throw light on
the witch mystery, gave rise to a speculative idea
that John and Drew Beil had learned ventriloquism
and some subtile art while on these trips
to New Orleans, and taught the same to their
young sister Betsy, for the purpose of attracting
people and making money. This conjecture was
widely circulated, and checked many people in
their purpose of visiting the scene of the excitement.
Notwithstanding this explanation was
accepted by many, it was the silliest of all solutions
attempted. If the parties were able to perform
such wonders, they only had to make the
fact known to have reaped a fortune. But to the
contrary, they tried to keep it a secret, and when
known it brought both suffering and loss to the
family. Moreover, John Bell, Jr., was absent,
visiting relatives in North Carolina, six months
or more during the height of the excitement, and
he could not possibly have had anything to do
with it. Drew was also absent at times, and still
no difference was observed in the manifestations
when they were both absent or present. The
witch entertained visitors in the reception room
just the same when Betsy was present or retired
to her own ehamber. There was also knocking
-----File: 046.png---------------------------------------------------------
on the doors and outer walls, and ratling on the
house-top heard, when every member of the family
were known to be within. And as soon as
the family and visitors retired for sleep, every
room full, doors and windows securely closed, the
cover was stripped from every bed and pillows
and sheets jerked from under strong men, If the
Bell brothers and sister had been capable of making
such demonstrations, could they have continued
the exhibitions so long undiscovered by
the shrewd detectives who were constantly on the
alert?) Or would they have heartlessly inflicted
so mueh distress upon their father and family?
No one in that community, familiar with the
facts and demonstrations, knowing the affections
of the children for their parents, and devotion to
each other, ever believed it. They knew it was
impossible. Betsy was not only frightened, but
was severely punished in so many ways that she
cheerfully submitted to any and every investigation
proposed, even to the ridiculous treatment
of cranks, conjurers, and witch doctors, in the
hope of relief from some source. Drewry Bell
never married. He lived quite a secluded bachelor's
life, accumulating considerable property.
He died at his home in that vicinity January Ist,
1865. It is said by neighbors that he lived under
-----File: 047.png---------------------------------------------------------
forbodings and dreadful apprehension that the
witch would visit some calamity on him. He
charged every strange noise and occurrence to the
haunt, reciting mysterious occurrences to his
friends, believing that the spirit was ever present
about his premises, and through fear he kept
some man employed on the place to keep him
company.

Richard Williams Bell settled on his portion
of the land inherited from his father's estate,
buying other interests, and devoted himself to
agriculture. He was endowed with a strong intellect,
and was the most cultured of the family,
noted for his splendid business qualifications and
frugality, and especially was he distinguished for
his integrity of character, his deep piety and
devotion to his religious principles, his tender
nature, and promptness in lending a helping hand
where help was needed. He was one of nature's
noblemen--a good man and valuable citizen.
He had not an enemy in the broad land. His
neighbors trusted him implicitly, and relied upon
him as a true friend and safe counselor in all
things, and his name is cherished to this day by
all who knew him.

Williams Bell was a boy at the time of the
witch affliction, whith the Bell's have akvays

alluded to as "our family trouble," but he was
old enough, and probably just the right age, to
receive a deep and lasting impression of what
occurred, what he saw, felt and heard, things that
were well calculated to impress a boy's mind.
He waited upon his father during the last year
of his life, and when able to go out, accompanied
him wherever he went about the farm or in the
neighborhood, witnessed his contortions and excruciating
sufferings, and heard the derisive songs
and fearful anathemas pronounced against him
by the witech--terrifying invictives that were calculated
to appall the stoutest heart and leave an
impress seared as by fire. The imprint was never
erased, and every recurring thought of the dire
events came like a convulsing nightmare. After
mature years he consulted with his brothers and
sister Bensy, comparing their recollections with
the notes of his own memory, frony which he
wrote the thrilling details of "Our Family Trouble,"
and no reader who ever knew the writer
will question the truth of a single word of it, no
matter what may be their faith or opinion concerning
the mystery, or their views about witchcraft
of olden times. Williams Bell died October
24th, 1857, at the age of forty-six years, just in
the prime of life and his greatest usefulness. He
-----File: 049.png---------------------------------------------------------
left a good estate for his widow and children.
He was three times married, his fist wife being
Sallie Gunn, daughter of Rev. Thomas Gunn:
second marriage with Susan Gunn, daughter of
Rev. James Gunn, and third wife, Eliza Orndorff.
James Allen Bell was the eldest son by
his first wife. He received careful training at the
hands of his father, and developed steady business
habits and strong convictions, attaining to proiinence
quite early in life, taking a leading place
in polities and public affairs, and about 1876 was
nominated by the County Democratic Convention
and elected by the people to represent the county
in the State Legislature. At the close of the term
he sold his farm and other interests in Robertson
'county and moved to Adairville, KRy.. engaging
in the tobacco business, where he still resides,
and is highly esteemed by the people of both
Logan and Robertson counties, He married Miss
Eugenia Chambers, a lady of many personal
charms and accomplishments. They have raised
three children, a son and two daughters, of whom
they have just cause to feel proud. Williams

Joel E. Bell was the youngest child of John
and Luey Bell. The writer enjoyed a personal
acquaintance with him for twenty-five years, and
learned to appreciate his warm and_= generous
friendship. He was a man of noble impuise,
clear practicable head and settled convictions,
moved by an indomitable spirit full of fiery enthusiasm,
and always left a strong and pleasing
impress on those with whom he came in contact,
He took a leading part in all matters looking to
the advancement of the public welfare, and his
zeal for the accomplishment of whatever he undertook
knew no bounds. Te was a strong Raptist,
a religious enthusiast, always overflowing
with the love of God, and his last days were spent
in zealous work for the Master's cause, He
attended the associational mectings, delivered
happy little speeches pregnant with practical
ideas, infusing spirit in the members, giving freely
of his own means for the advancement of religious
enterprises. There are but few Baptist ministers
and prominent laymen in Tennessee and Southern
Kentucky who do not remember old Brother Bell
with tender emotions. He died in 1890 at the
age of seventy-seven vears, ripe for the enjoyment
of that sweet repose which remains for the righteous,
Joel Bell sold his farm in the west end of
-----File: 051.png---------------------------------------------------------
the county, the place now occupied by Lee Sinith,
about 1855, and moved to a large brick dwelling
at the cross roads four miles north of Springfield--the
Adairville road--where he died. He
was twice married, and was fortunate in both
matches.

CHAPTER IV.

Betsy Bell and Her Triuls.

Klizabeth, the youngest daughter of John and
Lucy Bell, was born in 1805, and was only twelve
years of age when "our family troubles" commeneed--a_
light-hearted, romping lass, whose
roguish beauty and mischievous glance made the'
hearts of the boys go pitipat, while she yet enjoyed
most the gay notes of the woodland songsters,
or a stroll with her associates in scareh of
wild flowers, berries, cte., along the river side,
where the murmuring waves lent an enchantment
to the pursuit. Betsy, however, developed rapidly,
and ac the age of fifteen had ripened into
lovely young womanhood, and was noted for her
extraordinary beauty and winsome ways. She
was a blonde, symmetrical in form, presenting a
charming figure of uncommon grace, with a fine
-----File: 052.png---------------------------------------------------------
48 THLE BELL WELCH

suit of soft silky hair, which hung in beautiful
waves, in contrast with her fair complexion, and
with all, there was enchantment in. the mischievous
twinkle of her large deeply set blue eves.
She was also characterized tor her keen wit and
sparkling humor; nor had her domestie education,
that which added most to a young girl's
popularity in olden times, been neglected, to all
of which must be added industrious habits, gentleness
and womanly dignity. It is no wonder
that she was the pet of the family and the favorite
in society, nor is it surprising that young Joshua
Gardner should have lost both his head and heart
in admiration for the fair beauty in whom the
observing bachelor school master discovered so
many charms. Gardner had now become very
earnest in his devotions, and was never more
happy than when in her society. And it was
said that the sentiment was reciprocated, he being
the first young man to impress her with his attentions,
In fact their fondness for each others
society became the subject of general remark
among the young people. They were regarded
as lovers, and Joshua was the recipient of many
congratulations on his good fortune in winning
the affections of the fairest beauty in the land.
The athlance was marked by a passionate tender-*
-----File: 053.png---------------------------------------------------------
ness and adoration which neither could well conceal,
and it was given still more notoriety by the
witch, whose keen observations and cutting remarks
frequently drove them from the presence
of other company, for a walk in the lawn or seats
under the favorite pear-tree. However, it was the
manner in which Kate appeared that caused serious
forebodings. It was a soft melancholy voice,
sighing in the distance and gradually approaching
nearer with gentle pleadings in loud whispers,
"Please Betsy Bell, don't have Joshua Gardner.
Please Betsy Bell, don't marry Joshua Gardner."
Over dind over was this entreaty earnestly repeated
by the mysterious voice in the most beseeching
and supplicating tones, so doleful and disconso-late
that it caused a shudder to creep over every
one who heard it. It was so intensely persuasive,
gentle and sweet, so extremely mystifying,
that it not only bewildered the lovers, but brought
perplexity and confusion into every social circle
where the matter was discussed as the most
absorbing theme. Why should Betsy Bell not
wed Joshua Gardner? He was handsome and
gracious, well educated, intelligent and entertaining,
high spirited, industrious end energetic, and

sessed sufficient means for a good start in life.
His integrity wes above reproach, and he stood
before the community as a model young man.
Then why this dismal foreboding of the witeh?
Why should Betsy Bell spurn his manly devotions?.
No one could surmise or conjecture a
single reason, and all hearts warmed in deep syinpathy
for their betrothment, Betsy had suffered
extreme torture, the anguish of terror by contact
with the frightful ghost, and was deeply impressed
with the witch's earnest solicitude as a premonition
of some dire consequence. Joshua, however,
was stouter of heart. The burning passion which
thrilled his soul was like a consuming flame, and
grew stronger as the persecutions increased. He
had his own opinions and conjectures about the
mystery, and though he could not solve it, he
was willing to brovk all danger of the witch's
power to visit distress or greater evil than had
already been inflicted, and he was ready to endure
all for the sake of her whom he loved so tenderly,
madly. He was assured that Betsy loved him
as passionately in return. Her's was a stronger,
a more ratianal devotion, looking also to the
future, weighing deliberately' the consequences
that might result from a mistake, and thought it
best to prolong the engagement and await further
-----File: 055.png---------------------------------------------------------
developments, hoping that the mystery might be
solved or the witch would disappear, leaving them
in the full enjoyment of each other's love, and all
of their sweet anticipations of uninterrupted happiness.
This was the agreement, and there was
no abatement in their devotions; the attachment

'grew stronger and the ties more tender and passionate.
Betsy was not without friends, svmpathy
and consolation all through this long and
trying ordeal. Her parents were deeply sensible
of her sufferings and the cloud of sorrow that
overshadowed her, threatening to crush the spirit
and hope of her young life, and did all that was
in their power to alleviate her distress. Her
mother, Mrs. Lucy Bell, whose influence was the
controling power, and swaved like magic in molding
and shaping the character of her children,
was watchful of her every want and care. The
brothers were not negligent in providing diversions
fur her relaxation. Theny Thorn and
Becky Porter never deserted her in moments
when courage was needed to withstand the dreadful
scenes that were enacted. They witnessed
the fearful convulsions of hysteria which so frequently
came on suddenly, with the announcement
of Kate's presence, suppressing her breath
until life was almost extinet. They had heard
-----File: 056.png---------------------------------------------------------
52 THE BELL WITCH,

her frantic screams from violent pain, complaining
that the "old thing" was sticking pins in her
body. They had heard the sound of the blow,
and saw the tinge left by the invisible hand that
slapped her cheeks. They had seen her tucking
comb snatched by magie from her head and
slammed on the floor, her beautiful hair dis-+
heveled and all tangled in an instant, and heard
Kate's hilarious laughter enjoying the freak.
They had witnessed her shoes coming unlaced
and slipping from her feet at the witch's suggestion,
and observed many other terrifying and
tormenting acts, accompanied with vile threats,
while watching with Betsy night after night, gossipping
with the witch that she might have some
rest. But few girls could be persuaded to withstand
such frightful scenes under apprehensions
of greater calamity, but timid as they were their
sympathy and devotion made them strong;
courageous to endure and suffer with their friend
in any misfortune that might come. Their presence
and sympathy encouraged Betsy to bear her
persecutions, and hold out bravely in the hope
that the mystery would soon be dispelled. James
Long and Alex. Gooch were frequently-around
contributing to some diversion, and Joshua Gardner
continued his rapturous attentions, foregoing

every desire of his own heart for her pleasure
and comfort. Prof. Richard Powell had ended
his career as a pedagogue and was not so much
about the Bell home. He had entered the political
arena and become a leading politician and
foremost in all public affairs. He was several
times elected to the State Legislature, where he
distinguished himself as a law maker of ability
and gained wide popularity.

CHAPTER V.

The Homestead--Grarveyard--Witch. Stories and Surroundings.

The old Bell farm is about one mile from
Adams Station, a village which sprung into
existence in 1859-60, during the building of the
Edgefield and Kentucky Railroad, which is now
the Southeastern branch of the Louisville and
Nashville system. It lies on the south side of
Red River, bordering some distanee on that pretty
stream, stretching back nearly one mile over a
beautiful fertile valley. The greater portion of
the farm was cleared by John Bell during the
first twenty years of the present century. Here
-----File: 060.png---------------------------------------------------------
54 THE BELL WITCH.

Dean, the faithful negro who proudly mastered
the big wagon and team in the train from the old
Nerth State, that landed the family safely, deserves
honorable mention. We was noted for
being the best axeman and rail-splitter that ever
entcred the forest of this country. Ife was small
in statue, but powerfully muscled, and no two
meu were ever found who could match him in
felling timber, he taking one side of a tree, against
two men on the opposite, and invariably cutting
the deepest kerf: and so with the mall and wedge,
he could heat any two of the best ratl-splitters in
the country. Dean was as proud of this distinetion
as ever John Sullivan was of his pugilistic
championship, and he was indeed a valuable pian
in the forest at that time. as he was faithful and
useful every way, and Mr. Bell thought a great
'deal of him and tieated him kindly, as he did all
of his negroes. but money could not buy Dean.
Red River is a bold strong stream, with some
interesting seenery, and bubbling springs bursting
out along its banks. During the early settlement
the stream abounded with game and fish,
furnishing much sport for the natives, and young
people frequently gathered at favorite places for
picnics and fishing frolics. The noted spring
mentioned by Willams Bell in his sketch, desig-*
-----File: 061.png---------------------------------------------------------
nated by the witch as the hiding place of a large
sum of money, breaks out on the suutheast corner
of the place, near the river, from which flows the
bubbling waters of lethe.

The residence was a double log house, one and
a half stories high, a wide passage or hallway
between, and an ell-room with passage, the building
weather-boarded on the outside, furnishing
six large comfortable rooms and two halls, and
was one of the best residences in the country at
that time. It was located on a slight elevation
in the plane, nearly a half mile back from éhe
river, a large orchard in the rear, and the lawn
well set in pear trees, The farm has been divided
and the old buildings were long since torn away
and the logs used for building eabins, still standing
on the Joel Bell place, now owned by Lee
Smith. No one cared to occupy the premises
after the death of Mrs. Lucy Bell, when it-was
vacated, and for some time used for storing grain,
The only sign now remaining is a few scattered
stone from the foundation, and three.of thé old
pear trees that surrounded the house, planted
about the time or before John Bell bought. the
place, some ninety years ago. One of these trees
measures nearly seven feet around the 'trunk; it,
however, shows signs of rapid decay. The publie

highway, known as the Brown's Ford and Springfield
road, ran through the place within one
hundred yards of the house, and it was no uncommon
thing during the witch excitement to
find a horse hitched to every fence corner of the
long Jane, by peaple calling to hear the witch
talk and investigate the scnsation., Many stories
were told regarding spectres and apparitions of
various kinds seep, and uncommon sounds heard
along this lane--strange lights and jack-o-lanterns
flitting aeross the fed, There is nothing, however,
authentic run reference to these things except
the incident told by Dr. Goueh, who saw the old
house enveloped in flames, and the musical feast
at the spring, related by Gunn and Bartlett.
There were many superstitious people in the
country who believed the witch was a reality,
something supernatural, beyond human power or
comprehension, which had been clearly demonstrated.
This is the way many reasoned about
the mystery. Kate arrogantly claimed to be
all things, protesting the power to assume any
shape, form or character, that of human, beast,
yarment, fowl or fish, and circumstances went to
confirm the assertion. Therefore people with
vivid imaginations were capable of seeing many
etrange sights and things that could not be readily

accounted for, which were credited to the witch.
Kate was a great scapegoat. The goblin's favorite
form, however, was that of a rabbit, and this
much is verified beyond question, the hare ghost
took malicious pleasure in hopping out into the
road, showing itself to every one who ever passed
through that lane. This same rabbit is there
plentifully to this day, and can't be exterminated.
Very few men know a witch rabbit; only
experts can distinguish one from the ordinary
molly cotton tail. The experts in that section,
however, are numerous, and no one to this good
day will eat a rabbit that has a black spot on the
bottom of its left hind foot. When the spot is
found, the foot is carefully cut off and placed in
the hip pocket, and the body buried on the north
side of an old log.

Some of these people believed the spook escaped
from an Indian grave on the Bell place, by the
wreckless disintermert of the red man's bones,
but Kate's own statement, which was afterwards
contradicted, is the only shadow of evidence
found to sustain this opinion.

The Bell graveyard is located on a gravelly
knoll about three hundred yards north of the site
of the old dwelling, where repose the dust of John

On the opposite side of the river from the Bell
place. is the Williain La Prade farm, now owned
by MLL. Killebrew. and just below Killebrew's,
all between the river and Elk Fork Creek, is the
Fort settlement, a large and influential family,
distinguished among the pioneers, and whose
descendants still maintain the honored name.
On the east was located the Gunns and Johnsons,
all having good farms. James Johnson and two
-----File: 068.png---------------------------------------------------------
sons, John and Calvin, were Bell's nearest neighbors,
and next the Gunn families. James Johnson
was a grand old man. He was the founder
of Johnson's Camp Ground on his place, which
was kept up by his sons, the Gunns and other
good people, long years after his death, as late as
1854. Great crowds of people from a circle of
twenty or thirty miles, gathered there annually,
spending weeks in a season of religious enjoyment,
Many descendants of these excellent families--Gunne
and Johnsons--make up the present
citizenship, maintaining as a precious heritage
the good names left to them. Also the Goochs,
Longs, Porters, Jerry Batts, Miles, Byrns, Bartlett,
Ruffin, and other good names among the
early settlers, are still well represented.

One mile above Bell's, the Clark brothers had
a mill, to which the early settlers carried their
grain and grist. Later, Fort's mill was built
below, and several other mills erected on Elk
Fork. Morris & Merritt bought out the Clarks
and converted the old mill into a cotton ginning,
thread spinning and wool carding factory. It
was said that the witch took up at this factory
after seven years absence and return. The manager
told the story to customers, that frequently
after shutting down the mill, the operators would

hardly reach home before the machinery would
be heard apparently in full movement, and returning
hastily, opening the door, he would find
everything perfectly still as he had left it. There
is, however, no evidence to be had now verifying
the statement.

CHAPTER VI.

Mrs, Kate Batts and the Witch.

It is proper that the reader should, before perusing
"Our Family Trouble" and other accounts
of the witch, be introduced to Mrs. Kate Batts,
who was a noted lady in that community, remarkable
for her eccentricities, who survived long
after John Bell, and is well remembered by many
citizens still living. There were two Batts families,
who were in no way related. Jerry Batts
was a very prominet man, and his descendants
make up part of the present good citizenship of
that community.

Frederick Batts and wife Kate had three children,
Jack, Calvin and Mary. They had no relatives
and lived very much unto themselves.
Their children died in advance of the turn of life
and the family has become extinct. The boys
-----File: 070.png---------------------------------------------------------
62 THE BELL WITCH.

were tall, spindling and gawky, and very droll,
and did not take in society. Mary, however, was
a beautiful bright girl and very popular.  Frederick
Batts was an invalid, a helpless cripple, the
greater part of his life, and his wife Kate assumed
control of the farm, the family and all business
affairs, and was successful in accumulating by
her management, kecping the one idea of money
making before her. They were well to do people,
owned a very good farm, a number of negroes,
and were forehanded, having always some money
to lend. Nothing of a disreputable nature attached
to the family character. They were respeetable
people, except for Mrs. Batts' cecentricity,
which made many bold the family at. as great a
distance as possible. She was a large fleshy
woman, weighing over two hundred pounds, and
was headstrong and very exacting in her dealings
with men. She was exceedingly jealous of her
rights, not always knowing what they were, conceiving
the idea that everybody was trying to
beat her out of something. Her tongue was fearful.
She did not hesitate to tackle any man who
eame under the ban of her displeasure, with a
scourge of epithets. This, however, was tolerated
as a weakness, and excited the sympathy of the
better class, who humored her whims, but no one
-----File: 071.png---------------------------------------------------------
cared to encounter her organ of articulation when
she was in a bad humor, and especially the ladies,
who were generally afraid of her, and could not
endure her methods and dominating spirit. The
superstitious believed that she was a witch, and
this conjecture was strengthened by her habit of
begging a brass pin from every woman she met,
which tritle was supposed to give her power over
the donor, and some ladies were careful to put
their pins far away when "Old Kate" came in
sight. Notwithstanding Mrs. Batts was around
every few days, traveling her circuit once a week,
trading and gossipping, the superstitious were careful
to keep their apprehensions concealed from her.
They were all smiles and joy, and spared no
opportunity to make "Aunt Kate" happy in
everything but one--and were exceedingly regfetful
that there was not a pin on the place.

Mrs. Batts kept her negro women. employed
mostly at spinning, weaving cotton, flax and
wool, making jeans, linsey, linen, etc., and knitting
stockings after night until late bed time, and
always had something to sell, and would buy all
the surplus wool rolls and other raw material
wanted in her business, and this furnished her
an excuse for visiting regularly over the neighborhood.
Mrs. Batts was very aristocratic in her
-----File: 072.png---------------------------------------------------------
64 THE BELL WITCH.

own conccit, believing that her property entitled
her to move in the highest circle of society, and
she put on extraordinary airs and used high
sounding bombastic words, assimilating, as she
thought, aristocracy, which subjected her to much
ridicule and nade her the Jaughing stock of the
community. Moreover, she was anxious to give
her timid boy, Calvin, a niatrimonial boost, and
never hesitated to invade the society of young
people, who were amused by her quaint remarks,
The girls. however, dreaded her presence in mixed
company. lest she should unwittingly say something
to cause a blush. However she never neglected
to put in a word for her noble boy, who
resernbled a bean pole. ¢Girls, keep your eyes
on Calvin: he's all warp and no filling, but he'll
weave a yard wide'--referring to her own laree
proportions.

Mrs, Batts kept an old gray horse expressly for
the saddle. Old Gray was saddled every morning
as regular as the sun shone, though Aunt Kate
was never known tovride. She invariably walked,
carrying a copperas riding skirt on her left arm,
two Hfttle negro boys walking by her side, and
Phillis, her waiting maid, in front leading the old
gray horse. This caravan was known as "Kate
Batts' troop." No difference where she went, if

entering the finest parlor in the country, Aunt
Kate would habitually spread the copperas skirt
over the seat oftered her, and set on it. With all
of these peculiaritics and eccentricities, "Sister
Kate" was an enthusiastic Christian, always expatiating
on the Scripture and the goodness of
God, and would have her share of rejoicing in
every moeting, and it never required an excess of
spiritual animation to warm her up to business.
She was a member of Red River Church and a
regular attendant, always late, but in time to get
happy before the mecting closed.

On one occasion, Rev. Thomas Felts was conducting
a revival meeting, which had been in
progress several days, and a deep religious feeling
had been awakened, the house being crowded
every day with anxious people. Just as Parson
Felts had concluded a rousing sermon awakening
sinners to repentance, and called the mourners to
the front, and 'the whole audience engaged in
singing rapturous praise and transporting melody,
the Batts' troop arrived. Phillis observed "Old
Missus" had already caught the spirit and was
filling up on glory, hurriedly hitched Old Gray
and made a rush for the house. The meeting
had reached its highest tension, the house was
packed, and the congregation on fovot singing
-----File: 076.png---------------------------------------------------------

with the spirit. The interest centered around
Joe Edwards, whe was down on his all fours at
the mourner's bench, supplicating and praying
manfully. Joe Edwards was a good citizen, but
a desperately wicked and undone sinner, and
everybody was anxious to have him converted.
Especially were his religious friends in deep svmpathy,
sharing the burden of sorrow he was trying
to throw off, as he seemed to be almost at the
point of trusting, and the brethren had gathered
around, instructing and urging him on. Just at
this critical moment. Sister Batts rushed in, and
elbowing her way into the circle. she deliberately
spread her copperas riding skirt all over Joe
Edwards and sat down on him. The poor man
did not know what had happened; he felt that
he was in the throes of the last desperate struggle
with Satan and that the devil was on top. He
shouted and yelled the louder, "Oh J am sinking,
sinking. Oh take my burden Jesus and make
the devil turn me loose or I will go down, down,
and be lost forever in torment. Oh save me, save
me, blessed Lord."

A good brother invited Sister Batts to another
seat, but she politely declined with a flourish of
big words, as was her custom when putting on
dignified airs. "No I thank you; this is so con-*
-----File: 077.png---------------------------------------------------------
soling to my disposition that I feel amply corrugated."
"But," insisted the good deacon, "you
are crowding the mourner." "Oh that don't disburse
my perspicuity; I'm a very plain 'oman
and do love to homigate near the altar whar th'r
Lord am making confugation among th'r sinners."
"But, Sister Batts, the man is suffocating,"
still interposed the deacon. 'Yes, bless Jesus, let
him sufficate; he's getting closer to th'r Lord,"
exclaimed Sister Batts.

The situation had now become serious. The
whole house had caught on, and was bursting
with tittering laughter. Sister Batts felt the
foundation beneath her giving away, and was
caught by two brethren just as she threw up her
hands, in time to prevent a still more ludicrous
scene. Joe Edwards rose up shouting joyously
tor his deliverance, as if some unknown spirit had
snatched him from the vasty deep. Sister Batts
clasped her hands and shouted, "Bless th'r Lord,
bless my soul, Jesus am so good to devolve His
poor critters from the consternation of Satan's
mighty dexterity." The affair had reached such
a comical and extremely ludicrous stage, that the
audience could no longer restrain its resistibility
to a simper, and many left the house hurriedly
for an outdoor open air free Jaugh. This ended
-----File: 078.png---------------------------------------------------------
8 THE BELL WITCH.

the service, breaking up the meeting. The
preacher could do nothing but dismiss the remainder
of the congregation, who were suffering from
a suppressed tittering sensation, holding their sides
out of respect for the minister and religion.

Phillis was a strong believer in "Ole Missus."
Describing the incident she said: "I neber seed
Satan whipped outen er meetin' so quick in aller
my bawn days. Sooner 'an Ole Missus sot down
on dat man de devil tuek out vuder der flo an
de man hollered glory, glory, lemme up, lemme

ole Satan wuz mished clean outen him. Hit
made Mister Joe Edwards sweat like er hoss, but
he am got mighty good ligion now, dat will last
him tell der next meetin."

As soon as the ioquacious visitor developed the
propensity for articulation, people became importunate
in their entreaties, begging the mysterious
voice to disclose its character, nature, who or what
-----File: 079.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WiTCH. 69
it was, and what its mission, to which inportunities
various answers were given, but no explanation
that seemed to satisfy the anxious curiosity,
Finally Rey. James Gunn undertook in a conversation
with the gnome to draw out the information.
The goblin declared that it could not tr'fle
with a preacher or tell Prother Gunn a He, and
if he must know the truth, it was nothing move
nor less than old Kate Batts' witch, and was
determined to haunt and torment old Jack Bell
as long ashe lived. This announcement seemed
to fit the case precisely and satisfy a certain element
toa fraction, Less superstitious and more
considerate persons did not expect the witch to
divulge the trath, and of course did not believe
a word concerning Mrs. Batts' agency in the matter;
that was impossible. But the explanation
pleased those who wanted it so. It served for a
brand new and most startling sensation in the
mysterious developments, and all tongues were
set to Wagging. Men and women looked aghast,
and. said that was just what they had believed all
the while. Various suspicious circumstances
were recalled to confirm the witch's statement.
The most inconvertible evidence was that a certain
girl in the vicinity was given the task of
churning, and after working the dasher diligently
-----File: 080.png---------------------------------------------------------
70 THE BELL WITCH,

for two hours without reward, and no signs of
butter coming, she declared that old Kate Batts
had bewitched the milk and she was determined
to burn her. Carrying out this decision, she
stuck an iron poker in the fire, and after it had
come to a white heat, she soused the iron into
the milk, setting the churn away; then making
some excuse for the visit, she called on Aunt
Kate to ascertain the result of her experiment,
and found Mrs. Batts sitting in the corner nursing
aoburnt hand, which had been badly blistered
through a oiistake in taking the poker by the het
end that morning.

Another cireunstance. Mrs. Batts had been
heard to speak harshly of John Bell in regard to
a transaction she had with him vears back when
he firet moved to the scttlenient, declaring that
she would get even with him. Mrs. Batts was
not in the habit of saying many good thingr
about any one, tuless she got the best end of a
bargain in her dealings, but it is most prohable
that the old transaction referred to had been forgotten
by both parties until brought out by the
witch, and Jobn Bell hardly believed Mrs. Batts
capable or culpable in the mystery. However,
many were satisfied with the explanation, and
fron this on the witeh was called "Kate," and to
-----File: 081.png---------------------------------------------------------
this name the incomprehensible voice was always
pleased to answer. But there was music in the
breeze when this new censation reached the cars
of Mrs. Batts. Her eyes flashed fire, and her
tongue was let loose at both ends, rolling off
epithets like streaks of lightning. She kept every
path in the neighborhood hot for a month trying
to find the "corrigendum who dared to splavicate
her character with the spirifications of John Bell's
witch. She would show him the perspieuity in
the constipation of the law." Sister Batts, however,
never found the autnor of her diseom fiture.
The corrigendum was a shapeless, invisible, irresponsible
thing, and not subject to the law.

Kuowing the character of the men and women
who testify to these things, no one can disbelieve
them, or believe that they would have willfully
anisrcpresented the facts; nor can it reasonably
he said that so many reputable witnesses had
fallen into an abnormal state of mind, and were
so easily deceived in all of their rigid investigations.
A man may be arraigned for trial on the
charge of murder, the court and jury knowing
nothing about the facts and circumstances, lut
they are bound by: both physical and moral law
to believe and find the man guilty on the testimony
of reputable witnesses, detailing the facts
and circumstances, and yet may form no opinion
-----File: 083.png---------------------------------------------------------
or idea as to the state of mind or cause that
prompted the prisoner to commit the murder.
So it is in this instance; the testimony is convineing
of the truth of the wonderful phenomena at
John Bell's, but the motive or cause is beyond
our comprehension, and to this extent the facts
must be accepted. lt would be a shameful display
of one's ignorance to deny on general principles
the existence of the thing or fact, in the face
of such evidence, because he did not witness it,
and cannset comprehend it. Might as well the
jury, after hearing the evidence, discharge the
prisoner on the grounds that they did not see the
act committed, and could not believe the man
guilty of a dced so atrocious..

The writer, however, wishes to present every
phase of the Bell Witch phenomena, together with
seine quotations from the Bible on which many
people in all ages have based their superstition;
also the reasoning of some spiritually enlightened
and successful ininisters of Christ's doctrine, and
opinions on ancient witchcraft as presented by
the Bible, together with the ideas of modern
spiritualism, for the benefit of those who are disposed
to investigate. Christianity of the present
day has generally abandoned the doctrine of
"ministering spirits" as a faith leading up toa
-----File: 084.png---------------------------------------------------------
danger line where there can be no distinction
between that and modern spiritualism. Dr.
Bond, a distinguished Methodist divine and
editor, who has most forcibly combatted the faith
on the grounds that, that which cannot be explained
is not to be believed, and for the best
reason that many deeply pious minds have become
involved in confusion and error in trying to
exercise this discriminating faith, and he argues
that all premonitions, omens and spectral appearances
are a common phenomena of disordered
senses, and that the doctrine of the spirit world
is unscriptural and dangerous in the extreme, and
that theologians have no right to say that the
spirits of the dead live about us, and commune
with us, and oiinister to us.

Notwithstanding all such arguments and the
efforts to put away superstition, to ridicule and
laugh it out of existence, there is scarcely any
one who is free from every form of superstition.
Certainly the Christian world gets its superstition
from the Bible, if it is not innate, and it is very
hard to discard, and still accept all other things
that the Buok teaches as divine revelation. There
are but few people, however, who are willing to
admit their superstition, lest they be laughed at
and characterized as weak-minded, crazy, ete.
-----File: 085.png---------------------------------------------------------
Even Dr. Clark, the great John Wesley, the
founder of Methodism, and many other distinguished
writers and commentators, have not
escaped this criticism. Mr. Wesley, however, was
bold in speaking his sentiments and rather boasted
of his belief in witcheraft. He wrote and spoke
about the Epworth ghost that haunted the family
some thirty years.

Rev. T.. Tyerman, in his "Life and Times of
Wesley," savs Wesley has been censured and
ridiculed for this credulity. * * Did Wesley
deserve this? The reader must not forget the
undeniable, though mysterious, supernatural
noises in the Epworth rectory. He must also
bear in mind that one of the most striking features
in Wesley's religious character was his déep
rooted, intense, powerful and impelling convictions
of the dread realities of an unseen world.
This great conviction took possession of the man,
he loved it, cherished it, tried to instill it into all
of his helpers, all of his people, and without it he
would never have undertaken the Herculean
labor, and endured the almost unparalleled oppro-brium
that he did. Besides his own justification
of himself is more easily sneered at than answered.
He (Wesley) writes: "With my last breath, will
f bear my testimony againet giving up to infidels

one great proof of the invisible world; I mean,
that of witchcraft and apparitions, confirmed by
the testimony of all ages. The English in general,
and indeed, most of the men of learning in
Europe, have given up all accounts of witches
and apparitions as mere old wives' fables. Tam
sorry for it, and L willingly take this opportunity
of entering my solemn protest against this violent
compliment, which su many that believe the
Bible pay to those who do not believe it. I owe
them no such service. I take knowledge these
are at the bottom of the outery which has been
raised, and with such insolence spread throughout
the nation in direct opposition not only to the
Bible, but to the suffrage of the wisest and best
of men in all ages and nations. They well know
(whether Christians know or not) that the giving
up of witcheraft is in effect giving up the Bible;
and they know, on the other hand, that if but
one account of the intercourse of men with separate
spirits be admitted their whole castle in the
air--deism, atheism, materialism--falls to the
ground. I know no reason, therefore, why we
should suffer even this weapun to be wrested out
of our hands. Indeed, there are numerous arguments
besides this, which abundantly confute
their vain imaginations, But we need not be
-----File: 087.png---------------------------------------------------------
hooted out of one; neither reason nor religion
requires this. One of the capital objections to all
of these accounts is, 'Did you ever see an apparition
yourself?' No, nor did T ever see a murder;
yet I believe there is such a thing. The testimony
of unexceptionable witnesses fully convince
me both of the one and the other,"

Was Mr. Wesley right or not? John Wesley
was perhaps the greatest evangelist the world has
produced since the days of Paul, and now after
more than one hundred years can we, judging
from lis wonderful work, deny that the spirit of
God, and even ministering angels as he claimed,
attended him in his mighty spread of the gospel?
Was any living man ever endowed with such a
wonderful capacity for traveling, preaehing and
writing, under so many hardships and privations?
And does it not appear that.he was
inspired and guided by the same power that supported
Paul? The infidel may find some way of
denying this, but the Christian believer, hardly.
Then to deny Wesley's teachings respecting Bible
authority for witchcraft, or charge his, faith to a
disordered mind, is to accuse God with raising
up a great man to propigate a monstrous error,
and furthermore is to discard the hundreds of
passages all through the Bible from Genesis to

Revelations, and agree with infidelity that all
such Scripture is false, and that being false, there
can be nothing reliable in' God's Word. For
illustration take the case of the witch of Endor,
whom Saul approached in disguise after night,
because he had ordered all witches and wizards
put to death, and the witch of Endor was shy of
violating the erder. Now God had withdrawn
from Saul and answered him no more, and he
sought a familiar spirit. promising the woman
that no harm should come to her for this thing.
PF. Sam. xxviii, 3: Now Samuel was dead and all
Tsrac] had Jamented him, and buried him. Then
said the woman, Whom shall b bring up unto
thee? And he said, Bring me up Samud And
when the woman saw Samuel, Saul asked what
form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh
ap, and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped
avith his face to the ground, and bowed hiniself.
And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted
me, to bring me up?

Read the whole chapter--Sauls trouble and
Samuel's prophecy of what was to occur to-morrow,
ete. There can be no doubt that this was
the identical Samuel who had annointed Saul
King of Israel, if the Bible be true: moreover the

THE BELL WITCH. ve)
witch did not know Saul until after Samuel
appeared. This cannot be placed in the catalogue
of God's miracles, because it was the woman's
profession; and she is supposed to have brought
up bad, as well as good spirits, and she was popularly
known in the country as a witch possessing
this power, and therefore Saul was directed to go
to her. If this be a miracle, then God used
witehes and wizards to perform miracles, and
Paul and others who cast out devils in the name
of Christ, were wizards or seers. How will Christian
people who deny Mr. Wesley's position
reconcile this question? Furthermore, additional
light on this subject will be found in I. Chron.
xiii, Saul died for asking counsel of one that
had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it. Evidently
God did not approve of the works of this woman,
though He permitted such works, And why?
Because it is in aecord with the philesophy of
creation of worlds, the reign of devils on earth,
and designs of the Almighty in the scheme of
redemption, answers the believers in a spiritual
world. They hold from the teachings of such
Scripture, that there is a spiritual world, just as
this is a natural or material world. They held
that the inner man, or life, is a refined substance,
which, when'separated from the natural body by
-----File: 090.png---------------------------------------------------------

death, passes into the spiritual world as tangible
to those in the spiritual world as the body is to
the material world. Also that bad as well as
good spirits enter this spiritual kingdom, and
that there is a continual struggle between the
good and bad in that world as in this. They
believe that the spiritual body is a very refined
substance, like electricity, and that matter is no
chstruction to it, that it may and docs have communion
with the spirit in the body. knows every
thought and action of the human fiind, our
wants and necessities, and therefore departed
spirits become ministering angels or spirits to
friends in this world, and just in proportion as
man fives in nearness to God, spiritually, rising
high in the seale of mental and heart-felt devotion,
developing his spiritual nature--that refined
substance called animal electricity or magnetism,
which is the spirit--so much more is he capable
of recognizing the presence of ministering spirits
by communication or even by spiritual sight; and
that it is through this medium that people see
apparitions, receive premonitions and warnings
of what is to occur. These believers hold that
the visitation of angels so often recorded in both
the Old and New Testaments, were simply ministering
spirits, sometimes referred to as angels, and
-----File: 091.png---------------------------------------------------------
often as "man" or "men" and spirits. As in the
case of Paul, Acts xvi. 9: when "a man" appeared
to Pau] in the night, "There stood a man of Macedonia,
and prayed him, saying: Come over into
Macedonia and help us." Now the question,
who was this "man?" Was he a spirit, a Macedonian?
In Rev. xxii. the angel appearing to
John, tells him that he was one of the prophets.
The Psalmist says, "The angels of the Lord eneamped
around them, and delivereth them."
And again, "He shall give his angels charge over
thee to keep thee in all thy ways." The Apostle
Paul says, speaking of angelic spirits, "Are they
not ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to
them who shall be heirs of salvation?" So it, is
believed from these and many other such expressions
in the Bible, that the atmosphere possesses
the property of telegraphing that is yet to be
developed and better understood, by which the
spiritual world is in constant communication
with this, and that spirits travel like thought or
the electric flash, throughout all space in an
instant, and space is annihilated. It is, therefore,
believed that the principles of the moral government
of God are the same under every dispensation,
that this could not be changed in the very
nature of God's creation, and that the ministry
-----File: 092.png---------------------------------------------------------
82 THE BELL WiTcH.

of angels is taught and exemplified under every
dispensation, showing the uniformity of God's
works and government.

The question is asked: Are angels not men,
spirits that once dwelt in the body on earth?
Who wis "the man Gabriel" that spoke to Daniel
of the four great monarchie? Who was the
prophet that talked to John on the isle of Patmos?
Who was the "young man" that stood in
the sepulcher, clothed in a long white garment?
Whe were the "two men" that stood by them at
the sepuleher in shining garments, teHing the
disciples that "He is not here but is risen," as
recorded by Luke xxiv? Who were the "two
men" that spoke to the men of Gallilee when
Jesus ascended from Mount Olivet?--Acts i, 9-11.
This faith must be the most comforting thing on
earth to the soul that can exercise it discriminately.
But the danger is in suing too far, losing
sight of God, and relying on ministering spirits,
for there may be evil as well as good spirits, and
bow can one know whether the manifestation is
from Christ's Kingdom, or that of outer darkness?
God showed His disapproval of Saul's act in cailling
up so good a spirit as Samuel through a witch
medium, knowing that the Lord had withdrawn
from him on account of his wickedness and dis-*
-----File: 093.png---------------------------------------------------------
obedience; yet the witch was gifted with that
power--perhaps just as the present day mediums
have developed electrical force.

However, Mr. Wesley was not alone in proclaiming
this belief in a spiritual kingdom and
ministering spirits. Many Jearned theologians
support this doctrine. Dr. Adam Clarke, the
great scholar and commentator, in his Commentary,
vol. xi., page 299, savs: "TI believe there is a
supernatural and spiritual world in which human
spirits, both good and bad, live in a state of consciousness."
2. "T believe that any of these spirits
may according to the order of God, in the laws of
their place of residence, have intercourse with
this world, and become visible to mortals." This
doctrine is affirmed from the reason that Samuel
actually appeared to Saul; Moses and Ehias talked
with Jesus in the presence of Peter, James and
John, and there are many other such instances
recorded.

Dr. Richard Watson, of Eugland, who was
regarded as the most intellectual teacher the
Methodist church ever had, referring to the case
of Samuel, says: "The account not only shows
that the Jews believed in the doctrine of apparitions,
but that in fact such an appearance on this
occasion did actually occur; which answers all the
-----File: 094.png---------------------------------------------------------
objections which were ever raised or can be raised,
from the philosophy of the case, against the possibility
of the appearance of departed spirits. I
believe in this apparition of the departed Samuel,
because the text positively calls the appearance
Samuel."

In his "Theological Institutes,' a standard
work embraced in the course of study for ministers,
Dr. Watson says: "This is the doctrine of
revelation; and if the evidence of that revelation
can be disproved, it may be rejected; if not, it
must be admitted, whether any argumentative
proof can be offered in its favor or not. That it
is not unreasonable may be first established. That
God who made us and who is a pure spirit, can
not have immediate access to our thoughts, our
affections, and our will, it would certainly be
much more reasonable to deny than to admit;
and if the great and universal Spirit possesses
power, every physical objection at least, to the
doctrine in question is removed, and finite, unbodied
spirits may have the same kind of access
to the mind of man, though not in so perfect and
intimate degree. Before any natural impossibility
can be urged against this intercourse of spirit
with spirit, we must know what no philosopher,
however deep his researches into the courses of
-----File: 095.png---------------------------------------------------------
the phenomena of the mind, has ever professed
to know--the laws of perception, memory and
association. We can suggest thoughts and reason,
to each other, and thus mutually influence
our wills and affections. We employ, for this
purpose, the media of signs and words; but to
contend that these are the only media through
which thought can be conveyed to thought, or
that spiritual beings cannot produce the same
effects Gamediately, is to found an objection wholly
upon our ignorance. All the reason which the
case, considered in itself, affords, is certainly in
favor of this opinion. We have access to each
other's minds; we can suggest thoughts, raise
affections, influence the wills of others; and
analogy, therefore, favors the conclusion that,
though by different and latent means, unbodied
spirits have the same access to each other, and
us."

Dr. Watson related a remarkable instance which
serves to illustrate the views so forcibly expressed,
which was published many years ago in the
Methodist Magazine, and Jater in the Baltimore
Methodist Magazine. A man and his wife by the
name of James, both of whom died very suddenly,
leaving a large estate, as was supposed
without a will. There arose serious difficulty
-----File: 096.png---------------------------------------------------------
86 THE BELL WITCH.

among the heirs about the property. James and
his wife came back (in the day time) and informed
a lady where the will was, in a secret
drawer, in a secretary. She informed the circuit
preacher (a Mr. Mills), who went and found the
will, and reconciled the parties.

Bishop Simpsen said it seemed to him "as
though he were walking on one side of the veil,
and his departed son on the other. It is only a
veil. These friends will be the first to greet you,
their faces the first to flash upon you, as you pass
into the invisible world. This takes away the
fear of death. Departed spirits are not far above
the earth, in some distant clime, but right upon
the confines of this world."

Dr. Wilber Fisk says: "God has use or employment
for all the creatures he has made--for every
saint on earth, for every angel in heaven. Oh!
consoling doctrine! Angelsare around us. The
spirits of the departed good encamp about our
pathway."

Indeed it is a happy thought, a belief that
must keep the soul anchored by faith near. to
God, a realization that is worth all else in
a dying hour. How many of us have stood by
the bedside of a loved and sainted friend, when
the shadows were falling, watching every change
-----File: 097.png---------------------------------------------------------
of expression as they marked the features with
the light of joy, while the veil was being drawn,
affording a glimpse of the beautiful beyond, and
heard the sweet feeble voice utter exclamations
of rapturous praise for a vision too sublime to be
described? And have we not felt a sanctifying
awe prevading the heart as if conscious that the
atmosphere was full of ministering spirits? Ah!
"T would not live always." These are serious
thoughts and impression that the living delight
to cling to, nv matter what may be our opinions
concerning the spiritual world.

How anxiously we inquire after the last faint
expressions from the lips of dying saints, in the
hope of more evidence confirming the faith in a
blessed abode, where the soul shall live forever
in ecstasy. Can any one doubt that Bishop McKendree
recognized ministering spirits around
his dying bed when he cxclaimed--

"Bright angels are from glory come--
They are around my bed,
They are in my room,

They wait to waft my spirit home."

Can any one read the last days and the last
hour, yea, the last minute of John Wesley's life,
as recorded by Tyerman in his "Life and Times
of Wesley," vol. iii., beginning on page 651, with-*
-----File: 098.png---------------------------------------------------------
88 THE BELL WITCH.

out feeling enthused by rapturous joy expressed
by the great man, or doubt that the same ministering
spirits that he claimed attended him all
through his most wonderful and eventful career,
directing his course and warning him daily of
some new persecution that was coming, were
present, and beheld by him during the last moments
as the veil was drawn, when he exclaimed,
"PH praise! TH praise!" and then cried, Fare-well!"
the last word he uttered. Then as Joseph
Bradford was saying, "Lift up your heads, O ye
gates; and be ve lifted up, ve everlasting doors,
and this heir of glory shall come in!" Wesley
gathered up his feet in the presence of his brethren,
and without a groan and without a sigh, was
'gone.

Indeed there must be something exceedingly
comforting in this simple child-like faith, and it
does appear that no one need go astray as long as
such faith is well poised in God, looking to Him
always for spiritual guidance, rather than relying
directly on apparitions, premonitions, and spiritual
communications; a kind of self-righteousness,
forgetting that God has any hand in the matter,
and may permit bad spirits unrestrained, to deceive
the believer.

Recurring once more to Saul, who had in hix
-----File: 099.png---------------------------------------------------------
great zeal for God's cause, (or rather his own conceit)
"put away those that had familiar spirits
and the wizards out of the land," and would
have slain the witch of Endor had he known of
her, as she greatly feared, and cried with a loud
voice when Samuel appeared, saying, "Why hast
thou deceived me? tor thou art Saul," he was
conscious of having disobeyed the voice of the
Lord, in not executing His fierce wrath upon
Amalek, and knew that God was angry and had
withdrawn from him; and yet, in his sore distress,
when the Philistines were upon him, he
did not humble himself in the sight of God, imploring
pardon and Divine aid. He simply
"inquired of the Lord, and the Lord answered
him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by
prophets." Saul no doubt thought it was God's
business to direct him in saving Israel, and was
sulky, and in his own strength, went in disguise
to the witch he would have slain, "Wherefore
then dost thou ask of me, seeing the Lord has
departed from thee, and is become thine enemy,"
answered Samuel. Now mark two expressions
in this chapter, Samuel xxiii. "What sawest
thou?" inquired Saul. "And the woman said
unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth."
"An old man cometh wp; he is covered with a
-----File: 100.png---------------------------------------------------------
9 THE BELL WITCH.

mantle." It appears from this that the spirlt of
Samuel ascended out of the earth and came not
from above. Again, Samuel said to Saul, "Moreover,
the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee
into the hands of the Philistines; and to-morrow
shalt thou and thy sons de with me.' The question:
Where was Samuel, that Saul should be
with him on "to-morrow" when he fell upon his
own sword and was slain as prophesied? Samuel
came up out of the earth and Saul was certainly
not in favor with God, to warrant any belief in
his ascension to heaven, if Samuel was.

Another reference, Daniel v., gives an account
of the hand writing on the wall. Nebuchadnezzar,
to whom God had given majesty and glory
and honor, but when his heart was lifted up, and
his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed and
his glory taken from him, and be was driven
from the sons of men and become as a beast fed
with grass like oxen, till he knew that the most
high God ruled in the kingdom of men. Belshazzar,
his son and successor, knowing this, hum-bled
not his heirt, but made a great feast, drank
wine and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. This was
not all; he had the consecrated vessels which his
father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the Tem-*
-----File: 101.png---------------------------------------------------------
ple at Jerusalem and desecrated them in use in
his drunken revelry. "In the same hour came
forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over
against the candlestick upon the plaster of the
wall of the king palace; and the king saw the
part of the hand that wrote." "Then the king's
countenance was changed, and his thoughts
troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were
loosed, and his knees smote one against another."
None of the astrologers, the Chaldeans, sooth-sayers,
or wise men of Babylon, could read or
'interpret the hand writing, and Daniel of the
captivity who had an excellent spirit and knowledge,
was brought before the king and read the
hand writing, "Mene, mene, tekel, upharisin."'
The interpretation, "Thou are weighed in the
balances and art found wanting." "In that night
was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."
Again the question recurs, whose hand was this
that wrote upon the wall? Many believe it was
the hand of God, but the Bible says it was "fingers
of man's hand." Daniel says "the part of
the hand sent by Him," (God) and Daniel certainly
knew, for he was the only one who could
read and interpret the writing. Then it was a
man's hand and God sent it. Here again it is
claimed that the doctrine of spiritual communi-*
-----File: 102.png---------------------------------------------------------
92 THE BELL WITCH.

cation is sustained, and the laws of God being
immutable, just what was done then can be done
now, and therefore people cannot understand the
many mysterious things that occur, But the
moral. Belshazzar was not so much frightened
by the hand writing on the wall, as he was by
that inward conscience smiting on the wall of his
heart, which awakened him to a sense of his guilt
and condemnation, which caused his knees to
tremble and smite each other. The hand writing
was the warning of his doom, and that was what
he wanted to know. There is not a wrong doer
or sinner in this enlightened age, who has not
felt this same smiting of the heart. Conscience
is an all powerful spirit that cannot be resisted,
though it may not be heeded until the hand
writing appears on the wall.

We learn also from reading the Bible that there
was another class of extremist, religious bigots,
who believed that all spiritual communications
were works of the devil, and they made laws to
put mediums or witches to death. II.+Kings
xxiii. informs us of the great zeal of Josiah for
the house of the Lord. In the eighteenth year
of King Josiah the greatest passover known in all
the history of the Jews was holden to the Lord.
"Moreover, the workers with familiar spirits and
-----File: 103.png---------------------------------------------------------
the wizards, and the images and the idols, and all
the abominations that were spied in the land of
Judah, and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away,
that he might perform the words of the law which
were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest
fourd in the house of the Lord." Notwithstanding,
the Lord turned not from the fierceness of
His great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled
against Judah." This kind of zeal to please God
in some other way than by the sacrifice of a contrite
heart, and free communion with the spirit
of the Most High, has characterized all ages, and
down to the present time we find men who have
come in possession of great fortunes by stelth and
advantage, by which thousands have been impoverished,
giving munificent gifts:to charitable
institutions in the hope of winning favor with
God and gaining the praise of religious people,
and whose funeral orations team with glowing
accounts of their goodness in life. This was the
kind of opposition that John Wesley had to contend
with. He was reviled, hounded and vilified
by the ablest ministers of the Church of England,
books and pamphlets by the score were written,
and newspapers engaged in ridiculing his religion.
But the great man with a heart overflowing with
the love of God and humanity, by a single mild

utterance or the dash of his pen, turned all of
their anathemas against them.

Witches were burnt at the stake in the name
of the church, even in this country. The laws of
Massachusetts made witchcraft an offense punishable
by death, and the Puritans found no trouble
in procuring the-evidence to convict the aceused.
The first execution took place in Charlestown,
Mass., in 1648; Margaret Jones was the victim,
and John Wm.hrop, Governor of the State, presided
at the condemning trial. Witchcraft was
considered a crime against the laws of God, and
the persecution continued, and many were put
to death all along, but the great crusade occurred
in February, 1692, at Salem, when the excitement
reached its highest tension. Thirty women were
convicted that year on the testimony of children,
who claimed that they were tormented by the
women; twenty of the number were executed.

Out of such intolerance came the necessity for
religious liberty, a division of sentiment on Bible
doctrines, and the formation of many sects or
denominations into churches, and religious liberty
has continued to broaden into a mighty spread
of the gospel of Christ through the rivalry of
denominations, or rather a spirit of emulation,
each striving to do the most for the advancement
-----File: 105.png---------------------------------------------------------
of pure Christianity. But for these divisions and
religious liberty, zealots would have been burning
witches until yet. And if our churches could
all be united into one, under one universal creed
and Jaws of control, as some people desire, we
would return to witch burning within fifty years.
The world, and the churches as they are organized,
are full of religious bigots, who have no
patience with that class professing close communion
with God through the medium of the
spirit, because they themselves know nothing of
such religion.

The Bible has much to say about evil spirits
as well as good spirits, and all through Acts we
find that Paul.often came in contact with those
having evil spirits and those who practiced witchcraft,
sorcery, etc., but this the reader is familiar
with, while there are many authenticated phenomena
of later days that serve better for the
present purpose. No one now doubts the authenticity
of the Epworth ghost--"Jeffry." Rev. John
Wesley published the whole story himself in the
Arminian Magazine for October, November and
December, 1784. The demonstrations commenced
very much like the Bell Witch, by knocking and
other noise just by Mr. Wesley's bed. For some
time the Wesley family hooted at the idea of the

supernatural, but investigation finally settled
them in this conclusion beyond a doubt. It continued
to gather force just as did the Bell Witch
but never to the extent of talking or speaking.
When spoken to, the answers were in groans and
squeaks, but no intelligent utterance. It was
scen several times and looked like a badger. The
man servant chased it out of the dining room
once, when it ran into the kitchen, and was like
a white rabbit. Miss Susannah Wesley relates
'details which point to the presence of a disembodied
Jackobite, the knocking being more violent
at the words "our most Gracious Sovereign Lord,"
when applied to King George I, as generally
used by Mr. Wesley in his prayers. This being
noticed, when Mr. Wesley omitted prayer for the
royal family no knocking occurred, which Mr.
Wesley considered good evidence.

The Review of Reviews, New Year's extra number
for 1892, which is devoted entirely to the
scientific investigations of the Psychical Research
Society, contains in its wide scope of investigations
more than one hundred phenomena. The
story of a haunted parsonage in the north of England
in which the phenomena occurred in 1891,
the spirit was more demonstrative than the Eps-worth
ghost. The demonstrations consisted in
-----File: 107.png---------------------------------------------------------
ringing the bells, unlocking doors, turning down
the lamps as fast as the parson could go from
room to room, turning up and relighting the
wicks, and many other mysterious things, which
no human hand could have performed without
detection.

The rocking of Dr. William Smith's cradle,
which occurred in 1840, in Lynchburg, Va., is a
most remarkable and well authenticated phenomena.
Dr. Smith was pastor of the Lynchburg
church and many people called to witness
the strange action of the cradle, which commenced
rocking of its own accord, and rocked one hour
every day for thirty days. A committee was
appointed to investigate the cause, and the cradle
was taken to pieces and examined, every--part,
and put together again, and transferred to different
rooms, and it rocked all the same without any
hand touching it. Rev. Dr. Penn undertook to
hold it still, and it wrenched itself from his hands,
the timber cracking as if it would break in his
firm grasp.

Thousands of such pheromena, premonitions,
etc., well authenticated, might be cited, but there
is nothing on record. or in all history of phenomena
outside of the Bible, that equals the
deeply mysterious demonstrations of the Bell

Witch--seemingly a thing of life, like that of a
human being, endowed with mind, speech, and
superior knowledge, knowing all things, all men,
and their inmost thoughts and secret deeds, a
thing of physical power and force superior to that
of the stoutest man--action as swift as the lightning,
and yet invisible and incomprehensible.
Spiritualist undertake to account for such mysteries,
but their's is a very dangerous doctrine for
the ordinary mind to tamper with. One is liable
to lose sight of God and repose feith in the
medium. who is but a human being, and if possessed
with power to communicate with spirits,
may communicate with evil as well as good
spirits. Moreover, it is destructive to an unbal-anced
mind. All people possess more or less
animal electricity or magnetism, which is more
largely developed in one than in another, and
always more in the medium, whose will power
overbalances the other. This force, however, is
developed in-the practice of methods of communication,
and involves the whole mind and will

state, subjected to the electric force. Persons who
will sit for one hour daily, with their hands on
a table, giving all attention to spiritual manifestations,

sensation in their arms, and all through the system,
which should not be cultivated. It is better
that such investigations be left to the Society of
Psychological Research, scientific men of strong
minds who have nothing else to do but to demonstrate,
if they can, the theury that all such mysteries
are hiden in the yet mysterious electrical
force that permeates the atmosphere, the earth
and all animal nature, and which is being brought
into use, developing some new power or force
every day, and prove that we are nearing a spiritual
kingdom where the disembodied are to be
seen and conversed with.

Man is constituted a worshipping being, consequently
all men are superstitious, notwithstanding
that nine out of ten will deny most emphatically
holding to any kind of superstition. Yet
when put to the test not one of common intelligence
can be found who has not seen something,
or heard something, dreamed something, or
experienced premonitions, that left an impress
of the mysterious. For instance, a gentleman
fainiliar with the history of the Bell Witch, discussing
it with the writer, declared that those old
people were superstitious, and he did not believe
a word of it; that there was not a particle of
superstition in his composition; "yet," said he,
-----File: 110.png---------------------------------------------------------
190 THE BELL WITCH.

"there was something unaccountable at Bell's, no
doubt about that." Did he believe it? Why
certainly. Another instance: A very able, pious
minister, discussing the same subject in conneetion
with the Wesley haunt, said he did not
believe a word of such things; it was all spiritualism,
misleading and dangerous, and Wesley,
great man as he was, was liable to such mistakes
in an abnormal state of mind. Then he related
an incidentin the early settlement of the country,
when our fathers came among the red men. Said
he: "My grandfather belonged to the Nashville
settlement; he dreamed that the Indians had
attacked the little fort in Sumner county, while
the inmates were asleep, and killed every one.
He was awakened by the force of the presentment,
yet thought nothing of it, and fell asleep
again, and dreamed the same thing, the premonition
coming the second time with still more force.
He was greatly agitated, and mounted his best
horse, as quick as he could, running the horse
every jump of the way tothe little fort. Arriving
he found everybody sound asleep, and aroused
the people in great haste, shouting in the camp
that Indians were marching on the fort, and the
settlers had barely made ready when the enemy
attacked. The citizens won the victory, routing
-----File: 111.png---------------------------------------------------------
the Indians, without loss. But for the dream
and grandfather's prompt action, the last one in
the fort would have becn slain." Is this excellent
gentleman, believing his grandfather's story,
as he certainly does, free from superstition?
Summing up the whole matter, it is useless and
silly to condemn that which we know nothing
about and, cannot understand or explain. It is
an assumption of wisdom that discredits our
intelligence, and the best way to treat ghosts is to
let them alone, never go spook hunting, but if a
spirit comes to us, receive it just as a spirit
deserves to be treated, and observe the werning
on the wall, whether it be written by the hand
of a spectre, or indicted by the finger of conscience,

CHAPTER VIII.

The Story of the Bell Witch as Detailed by Richard
Williams Bell.

The reader is already familiar with the motives

that inspired Ricbard Williams Bell to write this

102 THE BELL WITCH.

sketch of "Our Family Trouble," a phenomenal
mystery that continued to be a living sensation
long after John Bell's death, the mention of
which in any Robertson county family, even to
this good day, leads to a recital of events as they
have been handed down through tradition.

After a brief biography of his parents and the
family, which is more fully recorded elsewhere,
Mr. Bell goes on writing:

After settling on Red River in Robertson
county, Tenn., niy father prospered beyond his
own expectations. He was a good manager, and
hard worker himself, making a regular hand on
the farm. He indulged no idleness around him,
and brought up his ehildren to work, endeavoring
to make tieir employment pleasurable. Mother
was equally frugal and careful in her domestic
affairs, and was greatly devoted to the proper
moral training of her children, keeping a restless
watch over every one, making sacrifices for their
pleasure and well being, and both were steadfast
in their religious faith, being members of the
Baptist church, and set Christian examples before
their children. Father was always forehanded,
paid as he went, was never in his life served with
un warrant or any legal process, and never had
occasion to fear the sheriff or any officer of the
-----File: 113.png---------------------------------------------------------
Jaw, and was equally faithful in bearing his share
of whatever burden was necessary to advance
morality and good society. In the meanwhile he
gave all of his children the best education the
schools of the country could afford, Zadok being
educated for a lawyer, while the other boys chose
to follow agriculture. Jesse and Esther had both
married, settled, and everything seemed to be
going smoothly, when our trouble commenced.
I was a boy when the incidents which I am about
to record, known as the Bell Witch, took place.
In fact, strange appearances and uncommon
sounds had been seen and heard by different
members of the family at times, some year or two
before I knew anything about it, because they
indicated nothing of a serious character, gave no
one any concern, and would have passed unnoticed
but for after developments. Even the
knocking on the door, and the outer walls of the
house, had been going on for some time before I
knew of it, generally being asleep, and father,
believing that it was some mischievous person
trying to frighten the family, never discussed the
matter in the presence of the younger children,
hoping to catch the prankster. Then, after the
demonstrations became known to all of us, father
enjoined secrecy upon every member of the fam-*
-----File: 114.png---------------------------------------------------------
104 THE BELT. WITUH.

ily, and it was kept a profound secret until it
became intolerable. Therefore no notes were
made of these demonstrations or the exact dates.
The importance of a diary at that time did not
occur to any one, for we were all subjected to the
most intense and painful excitement from day to
day, and week to week, to the end, not knowing
from whence came the disturber, the object of the
visitation, what would follow next, how long it
would continue, nor the probable result. Therefore
1 write from memory such things as came
under my own observation, impressing my mind,
and incidents known by other members of the
family and near neighbors, to have: taken place,
and are absolutely true. However, I do not pretend
to record the half that did take place, for
that would be impossible without daily notes, but
will note a sufficient number of incidents to give
the reader a general idea of the phenomena and
and the afflictions endured by our family.

As before stated, the knocking at the door, and
scratching noise on the outer wall, which continued
so Jong, never disturbed me, nor was I the
least frightened until the demonstrations within
became unindurable. This I think was in May,
1818. Father and mother occupied a room on
the first floor, Elizabeth had the room above, and
-----File: 115.png---------------------------------------------------------
the boys occupied another room on the second
floor; John and Drewry had a bed together, and
Joel and myself slept in another bed. As I remember
it was on Sunday night, just after the
family had retired, a noise commenced in our
room like a rat gnawing vigorously on the bed
post. John and Drew got up to kill the rat. But
the moment they were out of bed the noise ceased.
They examined the bedstead, but discovered no
marks made by a rat. So soon as they returned
to bed the noise commenced again, and thus it
continued until a late hour, or some time after
midnight, and we were all up a half dozen times
or more searching the room all over, ever nook
and corner, for the rat, turning over everything,
and could find nothing, not even a crevice by
which a rat could possibly enter. This kind of
noise continued from night to night, and week
after week, and all of our investigations were in
vain. The room was overhauled several times,
everything moved and carefully examined, with
the same result. Finally when we would search
for the rat in our room, the same noise would
appear in sister Elizabeth's chamber, disturbing
her, arid arousing all the family. And so it continued
going from roon to room, stopping when
we were all up, and commencing again so soon as
-----File: 116.png---------------------------------------------------------
106 THE BELL WITCH.

we returned to bed, and was so exceedingly
annoying that no one could sleep. The noise
was, after a while, accompanied by a scratching
sound, like a dog clawing on the floor, and increased
in force until it become evidently too
strong fora rat. Then every room in the house
wes torn up, the furniture, beds and clothing
carefully examined, and still nothing irregular
could be found, nor was there a hole or crevice
by which a rat could enter, and nothing was
accomplished beyond the increase of our confusion
and evil forebodings. The demonstrations centinued
to increase, and finally the bed covering
commenced slipping off at the foot of the beds as
if gradually drawn by some one, and occasionally
a noise like the smacking of lips, then a gulping
sound, like some one choking or strangling, while
the vicious gnawing at the bed post continued,
and there was no such a thing as sleep to be
thought of until the noise ceased, which was
generally between one and three o'clock in the
morning. Some new performance was added
nearly every night, and it troubled Elizabeth
more than any one else. Occasionally the sound
was like heavy stones falling on the floor, then
like trace chains dragging, and chairs falling over.
I call to mind my first lively experience, some-*
-----File: 117.png---------------------------------------------------------
thing a boy is not likely ever to forget. We had
become somewhat used to the mysterious noise,
and tried to dismiss it from mind, taking every
opportunity for a nap. The family had all
retired early, and I had just fallen into a sweet
dose, when I felt my hair beginning to twist, and
then a sudden jerk, which raised me. It felt like
the top of my head had been taken off. Immediately
Joel yelled out in great fright, and next
Elizabeth was screaming in her room, and ever
after that something was continually pulling at
her hair after she retired to bed. This transaction
frightened us so badly that father and mother
remained up nearly all night. After this, the
main feature in the phenomena was that of pulling
the cover off the beds as fast as we could
replace it, also continuing other demonstrations.
Failing in all efforts to discover the source of the
annoyance, and becoming convinced that it was
something out of the natural course of events,
continually on the increase in force, father finally
determined to solicit the co-operation of Mr. James
Johnson, who was his nearest neighbor and most
intimate friend, in trying to detect the mystery,
which had been kept a secret within the family
up to this time. So Mr. Jobnson and wife, at
father's request, came over to spend a night in
-----File: 118.png---------------------------------------------------------
the investigation. At the usual hour for retiring,
Mr. Johnson, who was a very devout Christian,
led in family worship, as was his custom, reading
a chapter in the Bible, singing and praying. He
praved fervently, and very earnestly for our deliverance
from the frightful disturbance. or that
its origin, cause and purpose might be revealed.
Soon after we had all retired, the disturbance
commenced as usual; gnawing, scratching, knocking
on the wall, overturning chairs, pulling the
cover off of beds, cte., every act being exhibited
as if on purpose to show Mr. Johnson what could
be done, appearing in his room, ax in other roonis,
and so soon as a light would appear, the noise
would cease, and the trouble begin in another
room. Mr. Johnson listened attentively to all of
the sounds and capers, and that which appeared
like some one sucking air through the teeth, and
smacking of lips, indicated to him that some
intelligent agency gave force to the movements,
and he determined to try speaking to it, which
he did, inquiring, "In the name of the Lord, what
or who are you? What do you want and why
are you here?" This appeared to silence the
noise for considerable time, but it finally commenced
again with increased vigor, pulling the
cover from the beds in spite of all resistance,
-----File: 119.png---------------------------------------------------------
repeating other demonstrations, going from one
room to another, becoming fearful. The persecutions
of Elizabeth were increased to an extent
that excited serious apprehensions. Her cheeks
were frequently crimsoned as by a hard blow
from an open hand, and her hair pulled until she
would seream with pain. Mr. Johnson said the
phenomena was beyond his comprehension; it
was evidently preternatural cr supernature], of
an intelligent character. He arrived at this conclusion
from the fact that it ceased action when
spoken to, and certainly understood language.
He advised father to invite other friends into the
investigation, and try all means for detecting the
mystery, to which he consented, and from this
time on it became public. All of our neighbors
were invited and committees formed, experiments
tried, and a close watch kept, in and out, every
night, but all of their wits were stifled, the demunstrations
all the while increasing in force, and
sister was so severely punished that father and
mother became alarmed for her safety when alone,
and the neighboring girls came almost every
night to keep her company. Especialiy were
Theny Thorn and Rebecca Porter very courageous
and kind to her in this trying ordeal. It was
suggested that sister should spend the nights with

110 THE BELL WITCH.

some one of the neighbors to get rid of the trouble,
and all were very kind to invite her. In fact our
ueighbors were all touched with generous sympathy
and were unremitting in their efforts to alleviate
our distress, for it had become a calamity,
and they came every night to sit and watch with
us. The suggestion of sending Elizabeth from
home was acted upon. She went to different
places, James Johnson's, John Johnson's, Jesse
Bell's, and Bennett Porter's, but it made no.
difference, the trouble followed her with the same
severity, disturbing the family where she went as
it did at home, nor were we in anywise relieved.
This gave rise to a suspicion in the minds of some
persons that the mystery was some device or
stratagem originated by sister, from the fact that
it appeared wherever she went, and this clue was
followed to a logical demonstration of the mistake,
satisfying all who entered into the investigation.
After Mr. James Johnson expressed his
opinion that there was an intelligent cause behind
the manifestations, other persons commenced
speaking to the witch, as it was then called, importuning
it to talk and tell what it wanted.
When spoken to, it was observed that the noise
would cease for a time, and then appear still
more demonstrative. This conduct went to con-*

THE BELL WITCH. ut
firm Mr. Johnson's opinion, and investigators
persisted with interrogations. By this time the
mystery had gained wide notoriety, and people
came from every direction, the house being
crowded every night with visitors, who came to
witness the demonstrations, and neighbors persevered
in their efforts to induce the witch to talk,
ealling on it to rap on the wall, smack its mouth,
etc, and in this way the phenomena was gradually
developed, proving to be an intelligent character.
When asked a question in a way that it
could be answered by numbers, for instance, "how
many persons present? how many horses in the
barn? or how many miles to a certain place?"
the answers would come in raps, like a man
knocking on the wall, the bureau or the bed post
with his fist, or by so many scratches on the wall
like the noise of a nail or claws, and the answers
were invariably correct. During the time, it was
not uncommon to see lights like a candle or lamp
flitting across the yard and through the field, and
frequently when father, the boys and hands were
coming in late from work, chunks of wood and
stones would fall along the way as if tossed by
some one, but we could never discover from
whence, or what direction they came. In addition
to the demonstrations already described, it
-----File: 122.png---------------------------------------------------------
112 THE BELL WITCH.

took to slapping people on the face, especially
those who resisted the action of pulling the cover
from the bed, and those who came as detectives
to expose the trick. The blows were heard distinctly,
like the open palm of a heavy hand,
while the sting was keenly felt, and it did not
neglect to pull my hair, and make Joel squall as
often,

The Witch Commenced Whispering.

The phenomena continued to develop force,
and visitors persisted in urging the witch to talk,
and-tell what was wanted, and finally it commenced
whistling when spoken to, in a low
broken sound, as if trying to speak in a whistling
voice, and in this way it progressed, developing
until the whistling sound was changed to a weak
faltering whisper uttering indistinct words. The
voice, however, gradually gained strength in
articulating, and soon the utterances became distinct
in a low whisper, so as to be understood in
the absence of any other noise. I do not remember
the first intelligent utterance, which, however,
was of no significance, but the voice soon developed
sufficient strength to be distinctly heard by
every one in the room.
-----File: 123.png---------------------------------------------------------
A Disturbed Spirit.

This new development added to the sensation
already created. The news spread, and people
came in larger numbers, and the great anxiety
concerning the mystery prompted many questions
in the effort to induce the witch to disclose
its own identity and purpose. Finally, in answer,
to the question, "Who are you and what do you
want?" the reply came, "I am aspirit; I was once
very happy but have been disturbed." This was
uttered in a very feeble voice, but sufficiently
distinet to be understood by all present, and this
was all the information that could be elicited
for the time.

The Seer's Prophecy.

The next utterance of any note that J remember,
occurred on a Sunday night, when the voice
appeared stronger, and the witch talking more
freely, in fact speaking voluntarily, and appeared
to be exercised over a matter that was being discussed
by the family. Brother John Bell had for
some time contemplated a trip to North Carolina
to look after father's share of an estate that was
being wound up, and was to start next morning
(Monday) on horseback, and this was the matter
that interested the family and was being dis-*

114 THE BELL WITCH.
cussed, the long tiresome journey, his probable
long absence, the situation of affairs, concerning
which father was giving him instructions. Several
neighbors were present, taking an interest,
volunteering some good natured advice to John,
when the witch put in, remonstrating against the
trip, dissuading John from going, predicting bad
luck, telling him that he would have a hard trip
for nothing, that the estate had not been wound
up, and could not be for some time, and he would
get no money, but return empty handed. As a
further argument to dissuade John, the witch
told him that an elegant young lady from Virginia
was then on her way to visit friends in
Robertson county, who would please him, and he
could win her if he would stay; that she was
wealthy, possessing forty negroes and considerable
money. John laughed at the revelation as
supremely ridiculous, and left on the following
morning as contemplated, and was absent six
months or more, returning empty handed as
predicted. Very soon after his departure, the
young lady in question arrived, and left before
his return, and John never met her.
A Spirit Hunting a Lost Tooth,
The witch continued to develop the power.of
-----File: 125.png---------------------------------------------------------
articulation, talking freely, and those who engaged
in conversation with the invisible persevered in
plying questions to draw out an explanation of
the mystery, and again the question was pressed,
inquiring, "Who are you and what do you want?"
and the witch replied, stating the second time,
"T am a spirit who was once very happy, but
have been disturbed and made unhappy." Then
followed the question, "How were you disturbed,
and what makes you unhappy?" The reply to
this question was, "I am the spirit of a person
who was buried in the woods near by, and the
grave has been disturbed, my bones disinterred
and seattered, and one of my tceth was lost under
this house, and IT am here looking for that
tooth."

This statement revived the memory of a circumstance
which occurred some three or four years
previously, and had been entirely forgotten. The
farm hands while engaged in clearing a plot of
land, discovered a small mound of graves, which
father supposed to be an Indian burving ground,
and worked around it without obliterating the
marks. Several days later Corban Hall, a young
man of the neighborhood, carne to our place, and
was told by Drew the circumstance of finding the
Indian graves. Hall thought the graves probably
-----File: 126.png---------------------------------------------------------
116 THE BELL WITCH.

contained some relics which Indians commonly
buried with their dead, and proposed to open one
and see, to which Drew agreed, and they proceeded
to disinter the bones. Finding nothing
else, Hall brought the jawbone to the house, and
while sitting in the passage he threw it against
the opposite wall, and the jarring knocked out a
loose tooth, which dropped through a crack in
the floor.

Father pasred through the hall in the meanwhile,
and reprimanded the boys severely
for their action, and made one of the negro men
take the jawbone back, replacing all the disinterred
bones, and filling in the grave. This was
evidently the circumstance referred to by the
"spirit," so long forgotten, and to be reminded of
the fact so mysteriously was very: perplexing,
and troubled father no little. He examined the
floor just where the bone dropped when it struck
the wall, as the boys had left it, and there was
the crack referred to, and he was pestered, and
decided to take up a portion of the floor and see
if the tooth could be found. The dirt underneath
was raked up, sifted and thoroughly examined,
but the tooth was not found. The witch
then laughed at father, declaring that it was all
a joke to fool "Old Jack."
-----File: 127.png---------------------------------------------------------
The Buried Treasure.

The excitement in the country increased as
the phenomena developed. The fame of the
witch had become widely spread, and people
came from all quarters to hear the strange and
unaccountable voice. Some were detectives, confident
of exposing the mystery. Various opinions
were formed and expressed; some credited its own
story, and believed it an Indian spirit; some
thought it was an evil spirit, others declared it
was witcheraft, and a few unkindly charged that
it was magic art and trickery gotten up by the
Bell family to draw crowds and make money.
These same people had stayed as long as they
wished, enjoyed father's hospitality, and paid not
a cent for it, nor did it ever cost any one a half
shilling. The house was open to every one that
eame; father and mother gave them the best they
had, their horses were fed, and no one allowed to
go away hungry; many offered pay and urged
father to receive it, insisting that he could not
keep up entertaining so many wifhout pay, but
he persistently declined remuneration, and not
one of the family ever received a cent for entertaining.
Father regarded the phenomena as an
affliction, a calamity, and such accusations were
very galling, but were endured. Inquisitive peo-*

ple continued to exercise all of their wits in plying
the witch with questious concerning its
personality or character, but clicited no further
information until the question was put by James
Gunn, then came the reply, "J am the spirit of
an early emigrant, who brought a large sum of
money and buried my treasure for safe keeping
until needed. In the meanwhile 1 dicd without
divulging the secret, and T have returned in the
spirit for the purpose of making known the hiding
place. and I want Betsy Bell to have the
money." The spirit was then urged to tell where
the money was concealed. This was refused and
the secret withheld until certain pledges were
made that the conditions would Le complied
with. The conditions were that Drew Bell and
Bennett Porter would agree toexhume the money
and give every dollar to Betsy, and that "Old
Sugar Mouth" (Mr. James Johnson) would go
with them and see that the injunction was fairly
discharged, and that he should count the money
and take charge of it for Betsy. The story was
questioned and laughed at, and then discussed,
The witch had made some remarkable revelations,
and it was thought possible there might be
something in it, and the proposition was acceded
to. Drew and Bennett agreed to do the work,
-----File: 129.png---------------------------------------------------------
and Mr. Johnson consented to become the guardian
and see that the right thing was done. The
spirit then went on to state that the money was
under a large flat rock at the mouth of the spring
on the southwest corner of the farm, on Red
River, describing the surroundings so minutely
that there could be no mistake. Every one was
acquainted with the spring, having frequented
the place, but no one could have described it so
minutely, and this ail tended to strengthen faith
in the revelation. The spirit insisted that the
committee selected should start very early the
next morning at the dawn of day, lest the seeret
should get out, and some fiend should beat them
to the place and get the méney. This was also
agreed to, and by the break of day next morning
all hands met and proceeded to the spring. They
found everything as described, the huge stone
intact, and were sure they were on time. They
observed that it was an excellent place for hiding
money where no human being would ever dream
of looking for a treasure, or care to move the great
stone for any purpose, and yet susceptible of such
a minute description that no one could be mistaken
in the revelation. They carried along an
axe and mattock, and were pretty soon at work,
devising ways and means for moving the big
-----File: 130.png---------------------------------------------------------
129 THE BELL WITCH.

rock, which was so firmly imbedded in the
ground. It was no light job, but they cut poles,
made levers and fixed prizes, after first removing
much dirt from around the stone, so as to get
under it. Then Drew and Porter prized and
tugged, Mr. Johnson occasionally lending a helping
hand, and after a half day's very hard work,
the stone was raised and moved from its bedding,
but no money appeared. Then followed a consultation
and discussion of the situation. They
reasoned that the glittering treasure was possibly
sunk in the earth, and the stone imbedded over
it to elude suspicion, and they decided to dig for
it, and went to work in earnest, Porter digging,
and Drew scratching the loosened dirt out with
his hands, and so on they progressed until they
had opened a hole about six feet square and
nearly as many feet deep, and still no money was
found. Exhausted and very hungry, they gave
up the job, returuing to the house late in the
afternoon much disgusted and chagrined. That
night the "spirit" appeared in great glee, laughing
and tantalizing the men for being so easily duped,
describing everything that occurred at the spring
in the most ludicrous way, telling how they
tugged at the big stone, and repeating what was
said by each one. Bennett Porter staved the
-----File: 131.png---------------------------------------------------------
mattock in up to the eye every pop, and oh! how
it made him sweat. It told how "Old Sugar
Mouth" looked on prayerfully, encouraging the
boys. The dirt taken out was mixed with small
stones, gravel, sand, etc., leaves and sticks, all of
which indicated that the earth had been removed
and put back. Drew, the witch said, could handie
a sight of dirt, his hands were made for that
purpose, and were better than a shovel; no gold
could slip through his fingers. The witch's description
of the affair kept the house in an uproar
of laughter, and it was repeated with equal zest
to all new comers for a month.

Priestcrajt and Scriptural Knowledge.

There were but very few churches in the country
at this period of the century, nevertheless;
ours was a very religious community. Most of
those coming from the older States brought their
religion with them, and inculecated the principle
in their families. The influence of Revs. James
and Thomas Gunn, Rev. Sugg Fort, Mr. James
Johnson, and other good men, swayed mightily.
Every man erected an altar in his own home,
and it was conmon for neighbors to meet during
the week at one or another's house for prayer and
exhortation, and Bible study. In the absence of
-----File: 132.png---------------------------------------------------------
122 THE BELL WIT,

the preachers, Mr. James Johnson was the principal
leader in these exercises, and the meetings
were held alternately at his house and father's,
and occasionally at one or the other of the
Gunn's. There was no spirit of denominational
jealousy existing, and all Christians mingled in
these meetings like brethren of the same faith.
The witch, as it accumulated force, dissembled
this spirit, giving wonderful exhibitions of a
thorough knowledge of the Bible and Christian
faith. The voice was not confined to darkness,
as were the physical demonstrations. The talking
was heard in lighted rooms, as in the dark,
and finally in the day at any hour. The first
exhibition of a religious nature was the assimilation
of Mr. James Johnson's character and worship,
repeating the song and prayer, uttering
precisely the same petition made by the old gentleman
the night himself and wife came for the
purpose of investigation, and the personation of
Mr. Johnson was so perfect that it appeared like
himself present. It was not uncommon after this
for the witch to introduce worship, by lining a
hymn, as was the custom, singing it through, and
then repeat Mr. Johnson's prayer, or the petitions
of some one of the ministers. It could sing any
song in the hymn books of that time, and quote
-----File: 133.png---------------------------------------------------------
any passage of Scripture in the Bible from Genesis
to Revelations. The propensity for religious
discussion was strongly manifested, and in quoting
Scripture the text was invariably correctly
cited, and if any one misquoted a verse, they
would be promptly correeted. It could quote
Scripture as fast as it could talk, one text after
another, citing the book, chapter, and number of
the verse. It was a common test to open the
Bible at any chapter, and call en the spirit to
repeat a certain verse, and this was done accurately,
as fast as the leaves were turned from one
chapter of the book to another. It delighted in
taking issue on religious subjects, with those well
versed in Scripture, and was sure to get the best
of the argument, being always quick with a passage
to sustain its point. This manifest knowledge
of Scripture on the part of the witch was
unmistakable, and was the most mystifying of
all the developments, and strangers who came
from a long distance were eager to eagage the
seer in religious discussions, and were as often
confounded; and they were no less astounded
when the witch would remind them of events
and circumstances in their history in a way that
was marvelous. Just here one circumstance I
callto mind. The discussion had turned on the
-----File: 134.png---------------------------------------------------------

command against covetousness and theft. <A
man, whose name I will call John, put in, remarking
that he did not believe there was any
sin in stealing something to eat when one was
reduced to hunger, and could not obtain food for
his labor. Instantly the witch perniciously inquired
of John "if he eat that sheepskin." This
settled John. He was dumb as an oyster, and
as soon as the subject was changed he left the
company, and was conspicuously absent after
that. The result was the revival of an old scandal,
so long past that it had been forgotten, in
which John was accused of stealing a sheepskin.
This warlock was indeed a great tattler, and made
mischief in the community. Some people very
much feared the garrulity of its loquacious meddling
and were extremely cautious, and it was
this class who the invisible delighted in torturing
most. Nothing of moment occurred in the country
or in any family, that was not reported by
the witch at night. The development of this
characteristic led the people to inquire after the
news and converse with the witch as they would
with a person, very often inquiring what was
then transpiring at a certain place or house in
the neighborhood. Sometimes the answer would
be, "I don't know, wait a minute and I will go
-----File: 135.png---------------------------------------------------------
and see," and in less than five minutes it would
report, and the report was generally verified.
This feature of the phenomena was discovered in
this way: Brother Jesse Bell lived within one
mile of the homestead. He had been absent several
days on a trip, and was expected home on a
certain evening. After supper mother entered
the room, inquiring if any of us knew whether
Jesse had returned or not. No one had heard,
or could inform her. The witch manifested
much regard for mother on all occasions, and
never afflicted her in any way. On this occasion
it spoke promptly, saying: "Wait a minute Luce,
I will go and see for you." Scarcely a minute
had elapsed when the voice reported that Jesse
was at home, describing his position, sitting at a
table reading by the light of a candle. The next
morning Jesse came to see us, and when told the
circumstance, he said it was true, and just at that
time there was a distinct rap on his door, and
before he could move the door opened and closed
immediately. His wife, he said, noticed it also,
and asked me what caused it, and J replied that
I reckoned it was the witch. Every Sabbath
service that occurred within the bounds was
reported at night, the text, hymn, cte., and the
preacher also criticised, and everything of pecu-*

liar note was deseribed. The company was
treated one night to a repetition of one of Rev.
James Gunn's best sermons, preached in the
vicinity, the witch personating Mr. Gunn, lining
the hymn, quoting his text and prayer, and
preaching so much like Mr. Gunn, that it appeared
the minister himself was present. A
number of persons were present who attended the
meeting that day, and recognized the declamation
as the same sermon. Shortly after this, Rev.
James Gunn preached on Sunday at Bethel
Methodist Church, six miles southeast, and Rev.
Sugg Fort filled his appointment at Drake's Pond
Baptist Church, seven miles northwest, thirteen
miles apart, both preaching at the same hour,
eleven o'clock. It so happened that both ministers
came to visit our family that evening, finding
quite a crowd of people gathered in, as was the
cise every day during the excitement. Directly
after supper the witch commenced talking as
usual, directing the conversation to Brother Gunn,
discussing some points in his sermon that day.
Mr. Gunn asked the witch how it knew what he
had preached about? The answer was, "I was
present and heard you." This statement being
questioned, the vociferator begun, quoted the
text and repeated the sermon verbatim, and the
-----File: 137.png---------------------------------------------------------
closing prayer, all of which the preacher said was
correct. Some one suggested that Brother Fort
had the advantage of the witch this time, that
having attended Brother Gunn's service, it could
tell nothing about Brother Fort's discourse at
Drake's Pond. "Yes I can,' was the prompt
reply. How do you know? was the inquiry, "I
was there and heard him." Then assimilating
Rev. Fort's style, it proceeded to quote his text
and repeated his sermon, greatly delighting the
company. There was no one present who had
heard either sermon, but both ministers admitted
that their sermons had been accurately reproduced,
and no one could doubt the fact, or were
more greatly surprised than themselves.

The Afflictions of Betsy and Father.

The reader will understand that no feature of
the exhibitions already introduced was ever abandoned,
but continued developing virulence, or
beneficence and felicity. The practice of pulling
the cover off the beds was a favorite pastime, and
frequently the sheets would be pulled from under
the sleepers, or the pillows jerked from under
their heads, and other new performances added
to the exhibitions. The most serious consequence,
however, was the afflictions of Elizabeth and
-----File: 138.png---------------------------------------------------------
128 THE BELL WITCH.

father. Notwithstanding the invisible agency
feigned a tender regard at times for Betsy, as it
affectionately called her, it did not cease tormenting
in many ways, increasing her punishment.
The feint pretext for this was a manifest opposition
to the attention paid her by a certain young
gentleman, who was much esteemed by the
family, often interposing impertinent objections,
urging that these mutual relations be severed.
At least there was no other cause manifested, or
this would not be mentioned. Sister was now
subjected to fainting spells, followed by prostration,
characterized by shortness of breath and
smothering sensations, panting as it were for life,
and becoming entirely exhausted and lifeless,
losing her breath for nearly a minute between
gasps, and was rendered unconscious. She would
revive and then relapse, and it appeared that her
suffering was prolonged by the greater exertions
used for her restoration. These spells lasted from
thirty to forty minutes, and passed of suddenly,
leaving her perfectly restored zfter a few minutes
in which she recovered from the exhaustion.
There is no positive evidence that these spells
were produced by the witch. However, that was
the conclusion, from the fact that there was no
other apparent cause. She was a very stout girl,
-----File: 139.png---------------------------------------------------------
and with this exception, the personification of
robust health, and was never subject to hysteria
or anything of the kind. Moreover, the spells
came on at regular hours in the evening, just at
the time the witch usually appeared, and immediately
after the spells passed off the mysterious
voice commenced talking, but never uttered a
word during the time of her prostration. In the
meanwhile father was strangely afflicted, which
should have been mentioned in the outset, but
he had never regarded his trouble as of any consequence
until after sister recovered from the
attacks just described. In fact his ailment commenced
with the incipiency of the witch demonstration,
or, before he recognized the phenomenal
disturbance. He complained of a curious sensational
feeling in his mouth, a stiffness of the
tongue, and something like a stick crosswise,
punching each side of his jaws. This sensation
did not last long, did not recur very often, or
cause pain, and therefore gave him but little
concern. But as the phenomena developed, this
affliction increased, his tongue swelling from the
sides and pressing against his jaws, so that he
could neither talk or eat for ten or fifteen hours.
In the meanwhile the witch manifested a pernicious
dislike for father, using the most vile and
-----File: 140.png---------------------------------------------------------
130 THE BELT. WITCH. >
malignant epithets toward him, declaring that it
would torment "Old Jack Bell" to the end of his
life. As father's trouble increased, Elizabeth was
eradually relieved from her severe spells, and
soon recovered entirely from the affliction, and
never had another symptom of the kind. But
father was seized with another malady that caused
him much trouble and suffering. This was contortions
of the face, a twiching and dancing of his
flesh, which laid him up for the time. These
spells gradually increayed, and undoubted carried
him to his grave, of which I will have more to
say further on.
The Witch Named "Kate."

People continued to ply our loquacious visitor
with shrewd cager questions, trying to elicit some
information concerning the mystery, which were
with equal dexterity evaded, or a misleading
answer given. First, it was a disturbed, spirit
hunting a lost tooth. Next, a spirit that had
returned to reveal the hiding place of a buried
treasure. Then it told Calvin Johnson that it
was the spirit of a child buried in North Carolina,
and told John Johnson that it was his step-mother's
witch. At last Rev. James Gunn manifested
a very inquisitive desire to penetrate the
-----File: 141.png---------------------------------------------------------
greatest of all secrets, and put the question very
earnestly. The witch replied, saying that Brother
Gunn had put the question in a way that it could
no longer be evaded, and it would not do to tell
the preacher a flat lie, and if the plain truth must
be known, it was nobody else and nothing but
"Old Kate Batts' witch," determined to torment
"Old Jack Bell" out of his life. This was a startling
announcement and most unfortunate under
the circumstances, because too many were willing
to believe it, and it created a profound sensation.
Mrs. Kate Batts was the wife of Frederick Batts,
who was terribly afflicted, and she had become
the head of the family, taking charge of her hushand's
affairs. She was very eccentric and sensative.
Some people were disposed to shun her,
which was still more irritating to her sensative
nature. No harm could he said of Mrs. Batts.
She was kind hearted, and a good neighbor toward
those she liked. Mr. Gunn, of course, did not
believe the witch's statement, but many did, or
professed to, and the matter made Mrs. Batts very
mad, causing a lively sensation in the community.
Ever after this the goblin was called "Kate," and
answered readily when addressed by that name,
and for convenience sake I shall hereafter call the
witch Kate, though not out of any disregard for
-----File: 142.png---------------------------------------------------------
132 THE BELL WITCH.

the memory of Mrs. Batts, for after all she was a

clever lady, and did not deserve the cruel appel-

lation of "witch."

The Witch Family--Blackdog, Mathematics, Cyporryphy,
and Jerusalem.

The next development was the introduction of
four characters, assuming the above names, purporting
to be a witch family, each one acting a
part, making night hideous in their high carnivals,
using the most offensive language and uttering
vile threats. Up to this time the strange
visitor had spoken in the same soft delicate voice,
except when personating some individual. Now
there were four distinct voices. Blackdog assumed
to be the head of the family, and spoke in a harsh
feminine tone. The voices of Mathematics and
Cypocryphy were different, but both of a more
delicate feminine tone. Jerusalem spoke like a
boy. These exhibitions were opened like a drunken
carousal, and became perfect pandemoniums,
frightful to the extreme, from which there was no
escape. Father would most gladly have abandoned
home and everything and fled with his
family to some far away scene to have escaped
this intolerable persecution, but there was no
hope, no escape. The awful thing had sworn

vengeance, and for what cause it never named,
nor could any one ever surmise. Nevertheless,
when the question of moving was discussed, it
declared it would follow "Old Jack" to the remotest
part of the earth, and father believed it.
The family was frightened into consternation,
apprehending that a terrible crisis was rapidly
apprvaching. Many of our neighbors were frightened
away, fearing they would become involved
in a tragical termination. Others, however, drew
nearer, and never forsook us in the most trying
ordeal. James Johnson and his two sons, John
and Calvin, the Gunn families, the Fort's, Gooch,
William Porter, Frank Miles, Jerry Batts, Major
Bartlett, Squire Byrns and Major Pickering were
faithful and unremitting in their sympathy, and
attentions, and consolations, making many sacrifices
for our comfort, and not a night passed that
four or more were not present to engage the witch
in conversation, and relieve father of the necessary
attention to strangers, giving him much rest.
These demoniac councils were introduced by
singing songs of every character, followed by
quarreling with each other, employing chscene
language and blasphemous oaths, making a noise
like a lot of drunken men fighting. At this stage
of the proceedings Blackdog would appear as
-----File: 146.png---------------------------------------------------------
134 THE BELL WITCH.

peacemaker, denouncing the others with vehemence
and scurrility, uttering bitter curses and
threats of murder unless the beligerents should
desist and behave themselves, and sometimes
would apparently thrash Jerusalem unmercifully
for disobeying orders. These carousals were ended
only by the command of Blackdog, professedly
sending the family away on different errands of
deviltry, one or two remaining to keep up the
usual disturbance in different rooms at the same
time. On one occasion all four appeared almost
beastly drunk, talking in a maudlin sentimental
strain, fuming the house with the scent of whiskey.
Blackdog said they got the whiskey at John
Gardner's still house, which was some four miles
distant. At other times the unity appeared more
civil, and would treat our company to some delightful
singing, a regular concert of rich feminine
voices, modulated to the sweetest cadence and
intonation, singing any hymn called for with
solemnity and wonderful effect. The carousals
did not continue long, much to the gratification
of the family and friends, and our serious apprehensions
were relieved. These concerts were
agreeable closing exercises of this series of meetings,
and after they were suspended the four
demons or unity never, apparently, met again.
-----File: 147.png---------------------------------------------------------
It was plain old Kate from that on who assumed
all characters, good or bad, sometimes very pious
and then extremely wicked.
The Witch and the Negroes.

Kate manifested a strong aversion for the negro,
often remarking, "I despise to smell a nigger, the
scent makes me sick," and this no doubt accounts
for the fact that the negroes were never molested
in their cabins after night, but away from their
quarters they encountered a sight of trouble.
Kate's repugnance was mutual; the negroes disliked
the witch, and were careful to evade all
contacts possible by staying in after night, augmenting
that natural odor peculiar to the race,
which was now worth something. They were
afraid of the witch, and it was difficult to get one
out for an emergency. This fear was increased
by the miraculous stories told by Dean, who was
a kind of autocrat among the darkies, and by the
way, was a pood negro, father's main reliance for
heavy work, and noted for his skill with the axe
and maul and wedge. He was worth two ordinary
men in a forest clearing. Dean could see
the witch any time when alone, or on his way to
visit his wife, who belonged to Alex.Gunn. It
appeared to him, he said, in the form of a black
-----File: 148.png---------------------------------------------------------
136 THE BELL WITCH.

dog, and sometimes had two heads, and at other
times no head. The negroes would stand around
him with eyes and mouth wide open to hear his
description of the witch, his encounters and hair-breadth
escapes. Jie always carried his axe and
a witch ball made by his wife, according to Uncle
Zeke's directions, to keep the witch from harming
him. He came up one morning, however, rather
worsted, with his head badly bruised and bloody,
and always declared that the witch inflicted the
wound with a stick. Dean's stories are not to be
quoted as altogether reliable; he was allowed a
wide range for his vivid imagination. Harry, the
house boy, however, had cause for believing every
word Dean told. It was Harry's business to make
the morning fires before daylight. He became
negligent in this duty, and father scolded and
threatened him several times. Finally Kate took
the matter in hand, speaking to father, "Never
mind, old Jack, don't fret. I will attend to the
rascal the next time he is belated." This passed
off like much of such gab, but a few mornings
after, Harry was later than ever and father commenced
scolding harshly, when the witch spoke
again, "Hold on old Jack, didn't I tell you not
to pester; I will attend to this nigger." Harry
had just laid the kindling wood down, and was
-----File: 149.png---------------------------------------------------------
on his knees blowing the coals to a blaze, when
some unseen force apparently seized him by the
neck and frailed him unmercifully. Harry yelled
and begged piteously, and when let up the witch
spoke, promising to repeat the operation if he was
ever derelict again. Father said he heard the
blows as they fell with force, sounding like a paddle
or strip of weed, but could see nothing but
the boy on his knees yelling for fe. Harry was
never late after that. A rather funny trick was
played on Phillis, a twelve year old girl who
waited in the house and assisted her mother in
the kitchen. We had a Jog rolling on our place,
as was the custom in the country. After the
work was over, the youngsters, while waiting for
supper, engaged in some gymnastic exercises, trying
the difficult feat of locking their heels over
the back of their neck. Phillis observed these
exercises, and the next day stole away up stairs
to test her athletic capacity. » After several unsuccessful
attempts, she suddenly realized that
her feet had forcibly gone over her head and were
securely locked. Time and again Aunt Lucy,
her mother, ealled and Phillis as often answered
up stairs, but never came. Finally Aunt Lucy
got her dander up, and picking up a switch
started, saying, "Bound I fetch that gal down
-----File: 150.png---------------------------------------------------------
138 THE BELL WITCH.

them stars." Pretty soon there was a racket up
stairs, and Aunt Lucy had worn out the switch
before Phillis could explain that the witch had
her. The case of Anky, however, lends more
zest to the witch's characteristic antipathy for the
negro. Mother had taken notice of the fact that
Kate never made any demonstrations in the
eabing, and conceived the reason why, accepting
the witch's own statement. She exercised her
genius and hit upon a scheme to outwit Kate,
which was rather novel in its purpose. However,
she turned the matter over in her own mind
carefully, and spoke not a word about it, not even
to father, for the reason, perhaps, that she was
afreid of the thing, and believed she fared best
by cultivating the regard it manifested for her;
consequently no one knew a breath of her plans
until the outcome of the scheme was developed.
Anky was a well developed, buxom African gir},
some cighteen years of age--a real negro, so to
speak, exuberant with that pungent aromatic
which was so obnoxious to Kate's olfactory.
Mother had determined to cautiously test her
plan for getting rid of the witch, telling Anky,
in her gentle patronizing way. that she wanted
her for a house girl and desired that she should
sleep in her room. The girl manifested some
-----File: 151.png---------------------------------------------------------
misgivings, but felt complimented by the distinction
implied, and enquired of mother if she
reckoned the old witch would not pester her?
Being assured that there was not much danger,
that Kate would be too busy entertaining the
company to take any notice of her, her fears gave
way to her plucked up courage and she followed
mother's directions to the letter, keeping the whole
matter a secret from the other negroes and all the
family until the test was made as to whether the
witch would trouble her or not. So one evening
after supper Anky quietly slipped in the room
with her pallet and spread it under mother's bed,
fixing herself comfortly on it, to await the coming
in of visitors and the witch and hear the talking.
It was a high bedstead, with a white
fringed, counterpane hanging to the floor, hiding
Anky completely. She was delighted, and net a
soul except mother knew she was there. Very
soon the room was filled with visitors, keeping
up a lively chit-chat while waiting the coming
of Kate, and mother had taken a seat with the
company anxiously waiting to see the outcome
of her scheme. Presently the voice of the witch
angrily rang out above the din of conversation
with the exclamation, "There is a damn nigger
in the house, it's Ank; I smell her under the bed
-----File: 152.png---------------------------------------------------------
140 THE BELL WITCH.

and she's got to get out." In an instant a noise
was heard under the bed like that of a man clearing
his throat, hawking and spitting vehemently,
and Anky came rolling out like a log starting
down hill, her face and head literally covered
with foam like white spittle. She sprang to her
feet with wonderful agility, frantically exclaiming,
"Oh missus, missus, it's going to spit me to
death. Let me out, let me out," and she went
yelling all the way to the cabin, "Let me in, let
metin." The witch then addressed mother, 'Say
Luce, did you bring that nigger in here?" "Yes,"
replied mother, "T told Anky that she might go
under my bed, where she would be out of the
way, to her you talk and sing." "I thought so,"
replicd Kate, "TL guess she heard me. Nobody
but you, Luce, would have thought of such a
smart trick as that, and if anybody cls¢ had done
it I would have killed the damn nigger. Lord
Jesus, I won't get over that smell in a month!"

The Miusterious Hand Shaking.

The Johnson brothers, John and Calvin, perhaps
had more intercourse with the witch than
any other two men who visited our place during
the excitement. That is they talked more with
the invisible, Gutered niore earnestly into the in-*
-----File: 153.png---------------------------------------------------------
vestigation by cultivating friendly and intimate
relations. They were both very honorable men,
of high standing in the community, but were
very dissimilar in character. Calvin was a plain
unassuming man of strict integrity, free from
deception, faithful in everything he pretended,
and would not swerve from the truth or break a
promise knowingly and willfully under any circumstances.
John was more dexterous, of a
shrewd investigating turn of mind, guided by
policy, and would make use of all legitimate
means at hand to gain a point or accomplish a
purpose, and he cultivated the witch more than
any one else for the purpose of facilitating his
investigations. Kate was very fond of gab, and
John Johnson made use of every opportunity to
engage the mage in conversation, hoping to draw
out something that would give a clue to the mystery,
but it appears that all of his wits were
baffled, and that the seer was all the while aware
of his purpose. The question arose as to the
character of the blows received by so many persons
on the check after retiring. The sound was
like a slap of an open hand, and every one testified
that it left a sting like that of « hand, even
to the prints of the fingers being felt. Calvin
Johnson conceived the idea of asking the witch
-----File: 154.png---------------------------------------------------------
142 THE BELL WITCH.

toshake hands withhim. After much persuasion
Kate agreed to comply with the request, on one
condition, that Calvin would first promise not to
try to grasp or hold the hand that would be laid
in his, This he agreed to, and then holding out
his hand, in an instant he felt the pressure of the
invisible. Mr. Johnson testified that he felt it
very sensibly, and that the touch was soft and
delicate like the hand of a lady, and no one ever
doubted his statement. John Johnson begged
Kate to shake hands with him, persisting that he
was as good a friend as his brother, but the witch
refused, telling John "No, you only want a chance
'to catch me." John vowed that he would not
attempt anything of the kind. Kate still refused,
replying, "I know you, Jack Johnson; you are a
grand rascal, trying to find me out, and I won't
trust you." Two or three other persons claimed
to have shaken hands with the witch, which I
don't know about, though many testified to the
force of the hand as felt on the cheek.

He Stole His Wife.

It was not uncommon for Kate to recognize
strangers the moment they entered the house,
speaking to them on familiar terms. Here is one
instance I will note. Four strangers who had
-----File: 155.png---------------------------------------------------------
traveled a long distance (whose names I cannot
now remember, there were so many unknown
callers), arrived late on a dark night, and knocking
at the door, and were admitted. They were
unknown to any one in the house or on the place,
but the moment they entered the door, and before
they could speak to introduce themselves, Kate
announeed one by name, exclaiming, "He is the
grand rascal who stole his wife. He pulled her
out of her father's house through a window, and
hurt her arm, making her cry; then he whispered
to her, 'Hush boney don': cry, it will soon get
well"" The strangers were greatly confused.
They stood dumbfounded, pausing some time
before they could speak. The gentleman was
asked before leaving if the witch had stated the
facts in regard to his matrimonial escapade. He
said yes, the circumstance occurred just as stated.

Detective Williams.

A good locking stranger arrived who introduced
himself as Mr. Williams, a professional detective,
stating that he had heard much of the witch
nystery, which no one could explain, and having
considerable experience in unraveling. tangled
affairs and mysteries, he had traveled a long distance
for the purpose of investigating this matter,
-----File: 156.png---------------------------------------------------------
141 THE BELL WITCH.

if he should be permitted to do so; further stating
that he did not believe in either preternatural or
supernatural things, and professed to be an expert
in detecting jugglery, sleight-of-hand performances,
illusions, etc., and would certainly
expose these manifestations so much talked of
if given a fair chance. Father bid the gentleman
a hearty welcome, telling him that he was just
the man that was wanted. "Make my house
your home, and make free with everything here
as if your own, as long as you think proper to
stay," said father, and Mr. Williams politely
accepted the invitation and hung up his hat.
Mr. Wiliams was rather a portly, strong-muscled,
well dressed, handsome gentleman. He was no
less self-possessed, and wise in his own conceit,
full of gab, letting his tongue run continually,
detailing to the company his wonderful exploits
in the detective business, and was very sure he
would bring Kate to grief before leaving. A day
and night passed and Kate, for some cause best
known to the witch, kept silent, making no show
except a little scratching on the walls and thumping
about the room, just enough to let the company
know that the spirit was present. Mr.
Williams became very impatient, appearing disgruntled,
and spoke his mind more freely. He
-----File: 157.png---------------------------------------------------------
said to a coterie of gentlemen who were discussing
the witch, that he was convinced that the whole
thing was a family affair, an invention gotten up
for a sensation to draw people and make money,
and the actors were afraid to make any demonstrations
while he was present, knowing his profession
and business, and that he would most
assuredly expose the trick. One of the gentlemen
told father what Williams had said, and it made
him very indignant. He felt outraged that such
a charge should be made without the evidence,
by a man professing to be a gentleman, to whom
he had extended every courtesy and hospitality,
and had proffered any assistance he might call
for, and.in a rage he threatened to order Williams
from the place immediately. Just at this juncture
Kate spoke, "No you don't, old Jack, let
him stay; I will attend to the gentleman and
satisfy him that he is not so smart as he thinks."
Father said no more, nor did he take any action
in the matter, but treated Mr. Williams gentlemanly
as he did others, nor was anything more
heard from Kate. The house was crowded with
visitors that night, all expectantly and anxious
to hear the witch talk, and sat till late bed time
awaiting the sound of the mystifying voice, but
not a word or single demonstration of any kind
-----File: 158.png---------------------------------------------------------
146 THE BELL WITCH.

was heard from Kate. This confirmed the detective
in his conjectures, and he repeated to several
visitors his conclusions, declaring that the witch
would not appear again as long as he remained.
After they were ull tired out, mother had straw
mattresses spread over the floor to accommodate
the company. Mr. Williams, being the largest
gentleman present, selected one of these pallets
to himself. All retired and the light was extinguished,
and a night of quiet rest was promising.
As soon as perfect quiet prevailed, and every one
appeared to be in a dose of sleep, Mr. Williams
found himself pinioned, as it were, to the
floor by some irresistible force from which he was
utterly powerless to extricate himsclf, stout as he
was, and the witch scratching and pounding him
with vengeance. He yelled out to the top of his
voice calling for help and mercy. Kate held up
long enough to inquire of the detective, which
one of the family he thought had him, and then
let in again, giving him an unmerciful beating,
while the man plead for life. Al! of this occurred
in less than two minutes, and before a candle
could be lighted, and as soon as the light appeared
the pounding ceased, but Kate did « good deal of
talking, more than Mr, Williams cared to hear.
The detective was badly used up and the worst
-----File: 159.png---------------------------------------------------------
scared man that ever came to our house. He sat
up on a chair the balance of the night, with a
burning candle by his side, subjected to the
witch's tantalizing sarcasm, ridicule and derision,
questioning him as to which of the family was
carrying on the devilment, how he liked the result
of his investigations, how long he intended to
stay, etc. As soon as day dawned, Mr. Williams
ordered his horse, and could not be prevailed
upon to remain until after breakfast.

Kate Gets in Bed With William Porter.

William Porter was a very prominent citizen
of the community, a gentleman of high integrity,
regarded for his strict veracity. He was also a
good friend to our family, and spent many nights
with us during the trouble, taking his turn with
others in entertaining Kate, which was necessary
to have any peace at all, and also agreeable to
those of an investigating turn of mind who were
not afraid, and this was Mr. Porter's character;
like John Johnson, he rather cultivated the spirit,
and said he was fond of gabbing with Kate. This
seemed to please the witch, and they got along
on good terms. William Porter was at this time
a bachelor, occupying his house alone. The
building was a large hewn log house, with a par-*

tition dividing it into two rooms. There was
one chimney having a very large fire place, and
the other end was used for a bed room--entered
by a door in the partition. I give this as related
by Mr. Porter himself, to a large company at
father's, and as he has often repeated the same to
many persons, and no one doubted his truthfulness.
Said he: "It was a cold night and I made
a big log fire before retiring to keep the house
warn:. As soon as I got in bed I heard seratching
and thumping about the bed, just like Kate's
tricks, as I thought, but was not long in doubt as
to the fact. Presently I felt the cover drawing
to the back side, and immediately the witch
spoke, when I recognized the unmistakable voice
of Kate. 'Billy, I have come to sleep with you
and keep you warm.' I replied, 'Well Kate, if
you are going to sleep with me, you must behave
yourself." I clung to the cover, feeling that it was
drawing from me, as it appeared to be raised from
the bed on the other side, and something snake-like
crawling under. I was never afraid of the
witch, or apprehended that it would do me any
harm, but some how this produced a kind of
chilly sensation, a freak of all overishness that
was simply awful. The cover continued to slip
in spite of my tenacious grasp, and was twisted

into a roll on the back side of the bed, just like
a boy would roll himself in a quilt, and nota
strip was left on-me. I jumped out of bed in a
second, and observing that Kate had rolled up in
the cover, the thought struck me, 'I have got you
now, you rascal, and will burn you up.' In an
instant I grabbed the roll of cover in my arms
and started to the fire, intending to throw the
cover, witch and all in the blaze. I discovered
that it was very weighty, and smelt awful. I
had not gone half way across the room before the
luggage got so heavy and became so offensive that
I was compelled to drop it on the floor and rush
out of doors for a breath of fresh air. The odor
emitted from the roll was the most offensive
stench I ever smelt. It was absolutely stifling
and I could not have endured it another second.
After being refreshed I returned to the room, and
gathered up the roll of bed clothing shook them
out, but Kate had departed, and there was no
unusual weight or offensive odor remaining, and
this is just how near I came catching the witch."

Our School Bay Experience.
Major Garaldus Pickering, who was a distinguished
man of that day, kept a large school
near by, which Joel and myself attended, and
-----File: 164.png---------------------------------------------------------
150 THE BELL WITCH.
had many little experiences with Kate along the
way. The custom was to take in school as soon
as the teacher could get there, a little after sun-rise,
and dismiss about thirty minutes before
sunset. Our route was through the woods, and
some briar patches and hazel thickets by the way-side.
Passing these thickets, returning home,
sticks of wood and rocks were often tossed at us,
but never with much force, and we soon learned
not to fear any harm from this pastime, and frequently
cut notches on the sticks, casting them
back into the thicket from whence they came,
and invariably the same sticks would be hurled
back at us. After night Kate would recount
everything that occurred along the way. Even
if one of us stumped a toe, falling over, the witch
claimed to have caused it, and would describe
how it appeared in the form of a rabbit or something
else at certain places. Our most serious
trouble, however, was experienced at home, the
witch continually pulling the cover off, and
twisting our hair, and it was hard for a tired
boy to get any sleep.
Joel Severely Whipped.

It happened that Joel and myself were left to

occupy a room alone one night, and were troubled
-----File: 165.png---------------------------------------------------------
less than usual in the early part of the night, but
Kate put in good time just before day. It was
yuite a cold morning, and rather too early to get
up, but Kate continued pulling the cover off and
jerking my hair, and I got out of bed and dressed
myself. Joel, however, was much vexed, and
said some ugly things about "Old Kate," and
gathering up the cover from the floor, he rolled
himself up in it for another nap. Directly the
witch snatched it from him again. Joel became
enraged, pulling at the cover while Kate seemed
to be hawking and spitting in his face, and he
had to turn loose the cover. This made Joel
raving mad, and he laid flat on his back, kicking
with all his might, calling old Kate the meanest
kind of names. "Go away from here, you nasty
old thing," he exclaimed. Kate became furious
also, exclaiming, "You little rascal, Pll let you
know who you are talking to." That moment
Joel felt the blows falling fast and heavy, and no
boy ever received such a spanking as he got that
morning, and he never forgot it. It was obsolutely
frightful. I could do nothing for his relief.
He yelled frantically with all of his might, arousing
the whole house, nor did his punisher cease
spanking until father entered the door with a
light, finding him almost lifeless. The blows
-----File: 166.png---------------------------------------------------------
152 THE BELL WITCH.

sounded like the spanking of an open heavy
hand, and certainly there was no one in the room
but Joel and myself, and if there had been, there
was no way of escaping except by the door which
father entered, and that would have been impossble
unobserved.

Chasing the Shakers,

The Shakertown people at that time kept their
trading men on the road continually, traveling
through the country, dealing with the people.
They went in two's, generally on horseback, and
could be distinguished from other people any
distance by their broad brim hats and peculiarity
in dress. The two who traveled through our section
always made it convenient to call at our
house for dinner or a night't lodging. It was
about the regular time for these gentlemen to
come around, and near the dinner hour one of
the servants came in announcing to mother that
the Shakers were coming down the lane. This
was a notice to increase the contents of the dinner
pot. Kate spoke up immediately, exclaiming,
"Them damn Shakers shan't stop this time."
Father was troubled a good deal by breachy stock
on the outside pushing the fences down, and
generally sent Harry, a negro boy, around every
-----File: 167.png---------------------------------------------------------
day to drive away stock and see that the fences
were up. There were three large dogs on the
place that the boy always carried alung, and he
had them well trained and always eager for a
chase, and would start at his call, yelping furiously.
Harry was nowhere about. He was out
on the farm with the other hands. But instantly
after Kate spoke Harry's voice was heard in the
front yard calling the dogs, "Here Cesar, here
Tige, here Bulger, here, here, sic, sic," slapping
his hands. Not a soul but the Shakers coming
down the lane could be seen. The dogs, however,
responded with savage yelping, going in a fury,
following the voice that led the way aging them
on, and just as the Shakers were nearing the turning
in gate, the dogs leaped the fence at their
horses' heels, and Harry's voice was there too,
hollering, "Sic, sic, take 'em." The Shakers put
whip to their horses and the dogs after them, and
Kate vehemently aging the dogs on and hilariously
enjoying the sport. It was a lively chase,
and broke the Shakers from coming that way
again. The witch enjoyed the sport greatly,
laughing and repeating the affair to visitors, injecting
many funny expressions in describing the
chase, and how the Shakers held on to their big
hats.

154 THE BELL WITCH.
Mother Bell's Iliness--The Witch Sings Sweet Songs
and Brings Her Hazeinuts and Grapes.

The story of the hazelnuts and grapes
brought to mother during her illness was
hard for many to believe, and it may prove a
severe strain on the credulity of the reader, but
it is nevertheless true, and will be verified by
several worthy persons who witnessed the facts
and have stated the sane to many people. Kate
had all along manifested a high regard for mother,
often remarking, "Old Luce is a good woman."
This was very gratifying to the family; we were
all much devoted to her, and this earnest expression
of tender respect for her, so often repeated,
was to a great extent an assurance that whatever
might bef: I] other members of the family, mother
would be spared personal affliction. She was
fearful of the thing, and could not see any good
sense or policy in antagonizing what was now
evidently a powerful, intelligent and incomprehensible
agency, and therefore she conceived it to'
be the best policy to cultivate the kind manifestations
of the witch, and she exercised all the
gentleness of her nature toward Kate, as she did
her tender affections for her. children. This
proved to be the best policy, for it is evident that
-----File: 169.png---------------------------------------------------------
she appeased the seer's malace in many instances,
except in father's case, toward whom the malignity
was unrelenting and beyond control. About
the middle of September, 1820, mother was taken
down with « spell of pleurisy, and then it was
that Kate manifested a sorrowful nature, growing
more plaintive every day as the discase progressed,
giving utterance to woeful expressions that were
full of touching sympathy. 'Luce, poor Luce, I
ain so sorry you are sick. Don't you feel better,
Luce? What can I do for you, Luce?" These
and many other expressions of sympathy and
anxious inquiries were given vent by the
saddened voice, that now appeared to remain
constantly in mother's room, prattling all through
the day, changing to a more joyful tone when she
indicated any temporary relief. The persistent
jabbering and disquietude was enough to craze a
well person, but mother bore it all patiently, frequently
replying to questions. Sometimes she
would reply, "Oh Kate, Iam too sick to talk to
you." Then the voice would hush for some time,
as if chokeing expression. When anything was
wanted or called for that was needed for mother's
comfort, the witch would sperk promptly, telling
precisely where the article could be found. And
so the strange voice continued from day to day,
-----File: 170.png---------------------------------------------------------
156 THE BELL WITCH.
mystifying everyone who came to visit and minister
to mother's wants, and it was utterly impossible
to distinguish from whence it came, and yet
so pathetic as to affect the sympathy of everyone
who came within hearing. It was noticeable also
that Kate kept quiet when mother was apparently
at rest or sleeping. She rested better in the latter
part of the night, and was somewhat refreshed
for the m:ming, and as soon as she was aroused
Kate was heard inquiting, "How do you feel this
morning, Luce? Did you rest well through the
night? Don't you want to hear a song, Luce?"
Mother was very fond of vocal music, in which
Kate excelled, and it was her pleasure to reply,
"Yes Kate, sing something sweet." While the
witch sung a number of beautiful stanzas, the
following was the favorite, which was sung every
day:
Come my heart and let us try
For a little season
Every burden to lay by
Come and let us reason.
What is this that casts you down?
Who are those that grieve you?
Speak and let the worst be known,
Speaking may relieve you.
Christ by faith IT sometimes see
And He doth relieve me,

But my fears return again,
These ie they that grieve me.
Troubled like the restless sea,
Feeble, faint and fearful,
Plagued with every sore disease,
How can I be cheerful?

No rythmical sound or melody ever fell upon
the ear with sweeter pathos, coming as it did like
a volume of symphony from a bursting heart. I
have seen the tears tricke down mother's fevered
cheeks, while friends would turn away to hide
repressed weeping. Sick as she was, mother never
neglected to compliment the song. "Thank you
Kate, that was so sweet and beautiful, it makes
me feel better," which the witch seemed to appreciate.
Mother gradually grew worse, the disease
reaching a serious stage. The doctor was still
very hopeful, but the family and our good neighbors
were feeling the deepest concern. Father
became very restless and apprehensive of the
worst. Her appetite failed entirely, and this distressed
Kate wofully. The neighbors brought
all sorts of tempting good things to induce her to
eat, and this example the ohserving witch imitated,
conceiving the idea, no doubt, that the
most important thing was the discovery of something
agreeable to her appetite. and this was the
-----File: 174.png---------------------------------------------------------
158 THE BELL WITCH.

circumstonce that seemed to have inspired the
action of the witch in bringing the nuts and
grapes. Wild fruits were plentiful in the bottoms
and woods around the place, and were then ripening.
The first instance was the appearance of
the hazelnuts. The same plaintive voice was
heard exclaiming, "Luce, poor Luce, how do you
feel now? Hold out your hands, Luce, and I
will give you something." Mother stretched her
arms, holding her hands together open, and the
hazelnuts were dropped from above into her
hands. This was witnessed by several ladies who
had called in to see mother, and it was so incredible
that the floor above was examined to see if
there was not a loose plank or some kind of opening
through which they were dropped, but it was
found to be perfectly secure, and not even a crevice
through which a pin could pass. After some
time the amazement was increased by the same
voice inquiring, "Say Luce, why don't you eat
the hazelnuts?" Mother replied that she could
not crack them. Then the exclamation, "Well
I will crack some for you," and instantly the sound
of the cracking was heard, and the cracked nuts
dropped on her bed within hand's reach, and the
same passionate voice continued insisting on
mother's eating the nuts, that they would do her
-----File: 175.png---------------------------------------------------------
good. Next came the grapes in the same way,
the voice importuning her to eat them, that they
would do her good. Mother was thoughtful in
expressing her thanks, remarking, 'You are so
kind, Kate, but Iam toosick toeat them." From
this on mother steadily improved, coming out of
a severe spell that held her down some twenty
days, and no one could express more joy and
gladness than Kate, who also praised Dr. Hopson,
the good physician who brought her through
safely. As soon as mother was convalescent, Ketc
devoted more attention to the entertainment of
the large number of visitors who were constantly
coming to hear the mysterivus voice. One evening
the room was full of company, all deeply
interested in discussing the phenomena of the
grapes, etc., when the presence of the witch was
announced by the voice exclaiming, "Who wants
some grapes?" and before any one could answer,
a large bunch of luscious wild grapes fell upon
Elizabeth's lap. The bunch was passed around
and all tasted of the fruit, and were satisfied that
it was no illusion. Kate evince: remarkable
knowledge of the forest, and would tell us where
to find plenty of grapes, hazelnuts, herbs of every
kind, a good hickory for axe handles. or tough
stick for a maul.
-----File: 176.png---------------------------------------------------------
160 THE BELL WITCH.
Mrs. Martha Bell's Stockings.

Kate, as before intimated, visited the family of
Brother Jesse Beli quite often, making demonstrations,
but never to the extent of the manifestations
at home. Jesse's wife, whom the witch
called "Pots," observed mother's policy in humoring
the warlock, paying kindly attention to its
gabble, incurring favor or kindly relations, and
she too was treated with such consideration as to
relieve her fears of any immediate harm. Jesse
Bell and Bennett Porter had determined to move
with their families to Penola county, Mississippi,
and were shaping their affairs to that end, as soon
as circumstances would admit. This phenomena
I give as related by Martha herself, there being
no other witnesses to the circumstance, but I can
not doubt her statement, which is borne out by
other facts. Late in the afternoon she was sitting
out some ten steps on the east side in the shade
of the house, engaged in pealing apples for drying.
She heard a kind of buzzing or indistinct
whispering in her ear, and recognized at once that
it was the voice of the witch, and spoke to it, inquiring,
"What do you want, Kate? Speak out
so [ean understand you." Then the witch spoke
plainly, saying, "Pots, I have brought you a
-----File: 177.png---------------------------------------------------------
present to keep in remembrance of me when you
go to your far away new home. Will you accept
it?" She replied, "Certainly Kate, I will gladly
accept any present you may bring. What is it?"
Just then a small roll, neatly wrapped in paper,
fell on her lap. She looked up and around in
every direction, but no one was near, nor could
she discover from whence it came. In her confusion
the witch spoke again, saying, "I brought
it, Pots; see what a nice pair of stockings. I
want you to keep them for your burial, to remember
me, and never wearthem." She then stripped
off the paper and found a pair of elegant black
silk hose, for which she thanked Kate, promising
to keep them as requested. Martha said she discovered
an ugly sploch on one of the hose, which
she was eyeing with much curiosity, when the
witch spoke very promptly, remarking, "That is
blood. They killed a beef at Kate Batts' this
morning, and the blood spattered on the stocking."
Martha said she was so disconcerted and
perplexed that she could not speak, and Kate
departed, or said nothing more. Jesse Bell came
in from the field very soon, and when made
acquainted with all the facts as above stated,
determined to go at once to the Batts home and
ascertain the facts regarding the witch's story of
-----File: 178.png---------------------------------------------------------
162 THE BELL WITCH.

the butchering that morning. He dia not mention
the circumstance, but very soon Mrs. Batts
expressed herself as very glad that he had called,
stating that they had killed a fine young beef
that morning, and intended sending Patsy (his
wife) a piece, but had had no opportunity, and
wished him to take it, which he did. So this
part of the witch's story was confirmed, and Jesse
further ascertained from Mrs. Batts that it had
been a very busy day, and not one of the family
had left the place during the day, or but for tue
pressing engagement she would have sent the
beef to his house. Moreover, Martha Bell had
not left the premises, nor had any visitor been
on the place.

Dr. Mize, the Wizard.

During the period of these exciting demonstrations,
ever so many detectives, wise men, witch
doctors, or conjurers, came to exercise their skill
on Kate, and were permitted to practice schemes
and magic arts to their beart's content, and all
were brought to grief in some way, confessing that
the phenomena was something beyond comprehension.
One notable instance was that of Dr.
Mize, of Simpson county, Ky., some thirty-five
miles away, whose fame as a magician had been
-----File: 179.png---------------------------------------------------------
widely spread, and many brought word to father
of his genius, urging him to send for the noted
conjurer. The truth is, father had becomealarmed
about his own condition. His spelis of contortions
of the face, twitching of the flesh and stiff
ness of the tongue, were gradually growing more
frequent and severe. His friends observed this,
and also that the animosity of the witch toward
him was increasing in vehemence, every word
spoken to him being a blast of caluminous aspersions,
and threatenings of some dire evil which
was horrifying. He had also become convinced
from his observations, that this terrible thing had
the power, as it claimed, to so afflict him, and
that the purpose was to torture his life out, as it
also declared; and under these circumstatices he
yielded to the many persuasions to exhaust all
means and efforts to free himself and family from
the pestilence. He consulted with Mr. James
Johnson about the matter, who thought it would
be well to give Dr. Mize a trial, and further proposed
to go with Drew after the famous wizard.
So it was agreed that Mr. Johnson and Drew were
to start on the hunt for Dr. Mize after three o'clock
in the morning, while Kate was not about, and
clear the neighborhood before the morning hour
for the witch's appearance. The whole matter
-----File: 180.png---------------------------------------------------------
164 THE BELL WITCH.

was to be kept a profound secret, and no one was
let into the understanding. Drew made ready
to accompany Mr. Johnson on a business trip, to
be absent two or three days, and that was
all that was known about it. They got off
according to the arrangement in good time, and
had perhaps passed Springfield before day. Kate
came as usual that morning, observing first Drew's
absence, setting up an anxious inquiry for him.
Not one of the family could give any information
concerning him, and the witch seemed baffled
and disappeared, and was not heard again during
the day, but returned that night in great glee,
having discovered the whole secret, telling all
about Drew and Mr. Johnson's trip. Kate went.
on to say, "I got on their track and overtook
them twenty miles on the way, and followed along
some distance, and when I hopped in the road
before them, looking like a poor old sick rabbit,
'Old Sugar Mouth' said, 'There is your witch,
Drew; take her up in your lap. Don't you see
how tired she is?'" Kate continued to gossip
about the trip in a hilarious way, manifesting
much satisfaction in discovering the deep laid
scheme, but no one knew how true the story was
until Mr. Johnson and Drew returned the following
evening, when they confirmed everything

that Kate had stated. Mr. Johnson said that he
did not really believe at the time of calling Drew's
attention to the rabbit, that it was the witch, but
spoke of its peculiar action in a jocular way, as a
mere matter of pastime, nor did Drew think
otherwise of it. They found Dr. Mize at his home
east of Franklin, Ky., told him the story of our
trouble, and the information received concerning
his power to dispel witchery, etc. The Doctor
said it was out of the ordinary line of phenomena,
but he had no doubt of his ability to remove the
spell and expose the craft that had brought it on,
and he set the time, some ten days ahead, when
he would be ready to begin the experiment. <Accordingly,
the wise man put in his appearance,
having studied the question, and was prepared
for business, making boasts of his knowledge of
spirits and skill in casting out devils, much to
the disgust of father; who had about sized him
up on sight. However, like others, Mize was
treated courteously and allowed to pursue his own
plans. The wizard stayed three or four days,
hearing not a breath from Kate. In the meanwhile
he found an old shotgun which had been
out of repair some time, and he at once discovered
that the witch had put a spell on it. He soon
cleaned the old gun, readjusted the lock and trig-*
-----File: 184.png---------------------------------------------------------
166 THE BELL WITCH.

ger, performed some conjurations, making the gun
shoot as well as ever. This much, taken in consideration
with the fact that the witch had kept
perfectly quiet since his arrival, he considered as
remarkable progress, and he doubted the return
of Kate. Certain he was that the witch would
hardly show up as long as he remained; witches,
he said, were always shy of him. So Mize continued,
working sorcery, making curious mixtures,
performing incantations, etc., to the amusement
of those who observed his actions. Finally Kate
put in, questioning the conjurer impertinently
as to what he was doing, and the object of his
sorcery. Mize was nonplussed by the mysterious
voice, which he had not before heard, recognizing
that the witch had come to keep company with
him. He tried to be reticent and evasive, intimating
that a witch had no business prying into
his affairs. Kate, however, continued to ply him
with hard questions, and finally suggested to Dr.
Mize that he had omitted some very important
ingredients for his charm mixture. "What is
that?" inquired Mize with astonishment. "If
you were a witch doctor you would know how to
aerify that mess, so as to pass into the aeriform
state, and see the spirit that talks to you, without
asking silly questions," replied Kate. "What do
-----File: 185.png---------------------------------------------------------
you know about this business, anyhow?" again
inquired the bewildered conjurer. Kate then
told him that he was an old fool and didn't know
what he was doing, and then let in to cursing
Mize like blue blazes. Such a string of blasting
oaths was never heard, and Dr. Mize was frightened
out of his wits, and was anxious to get
away. "That thing," he said, knew so much
more about witchcraft than he did, that he could
do nothing with it. Mize arranged for an early
start home the next morning. Somehow his
horse refused to go off kindly, rearing and kicking
up. Finally Kate came to the rescue, proposing
to make the horse go, and accompany the Doctor
home. Immediately the horse started with a
rush, kicking and snorting, and went off at full
speed with the Doctor hanging on to the mane.
The witch came that night in great glee, describing
the trip home with the "old fraud," and the
tricks played on him along the way, just as Mize
described the affair to his neighbors.

The Doubles or Apparitions.

Much has been talked about Bennett Porter
shooting at the witch. Porter, according to his
own statement, did shoot at an object that appeared
to his wife and Elizabeth, as described by
-----File: 186.png---------------------------------------------------------

them, but saw nothing himself, except the bent
saplings in motion. This circumstance occurred
during the time the witch family appeared on
scene. Elizabeth was there on a visit to her
sister. Bennett Porter was absent during the
day, filling an engagement at Fort's mill, which
was in course of construction, and returned home
late in the afternoon. The hens were laying
about the stables, which were located on the
opposite side of the lane from the house. Esther
started across the Jane that afternoon to gather
up the eggs. Just as she passed from the yard
into road, she observed a woman walking slowly
up the lane toward the house, and she hurried on
her mission and returned just. in time to meet
the lady at the front entrance. She recognized
the person as one of her neighbors, and spoke to
her pleasantly, to which the woman made no
reply. She repeated the salutation, which again
failed to elicit any response. The woman appeared
to have taken off her bonnet and let her
hair down, and was engaged combing out her
hair as she walked, and stopped just opposite the
house, where Esther met her, continuing the
combing, and appeared deeply absorbed or troubled.
Esther said she invited the lady in the
house, repeating the solicitation several times, to
-----File: 187.png---------------------------------------------------------
which the woman paid no atteution. She felt
much chagrined by the strange conduct of her
neighbor, and concluded that something was
wrong with the lady or that she had become
offended towards her, and she passed in, leaving
the woman standing in the lane, combing her
hair. She called Elizabeth's attention to the
woman and her conduct, and they both observed
her still in the same attitude. Presently she
climbed on the yard fence, sitting there some five
minutes, still combing her hair, and then she
tucked it up in the usual way and left the fence,
crossing over into the stable lot, where she could
not have possibly had any business. The lot
inclosed some three or four acres, a grove mostly
of young saplings on the further side, in the
midst of which was a large knotty log. The
woman walked across the lot, passing around the
dog, when there appeared three other persons, two
younger women or girls, anda boy. Each one
bent down a sapling, sitting upon them and riding
up and down, giving motion to the spring
afforded by the bush. While this exercise still
continued, Bennett Porter returned home, finding
Esther and Elibabeth excited over the strange
demonstrations which they tried to point out to
him. Hesaid he could see the bushes in motion,
-----File: 188.png---------------------------------------------------------

but could not see the persons described. He suggested
that they were the witch apparitions, and
got his gun, insisting that Esther should shoot
at one of the objects. While he was getting his
rifle, the appearances let the saplings up and took
positions behind the log, first one and then another
showing a head above the log. Esther refused to
shoot, but directed Porter to shoot near a large
knot on the log, where one of the heads appeared.
He fired and his bullet cut the bark on the log
just where he aimed, but nothing more was seen
of the four persons, nor could they, as Porter
thought, have escaped from the lot without detection.
They all three went to the log, and searched
the lot over, and could discover no signs except
the bent saplings, and the mark of the bullet on
the log. Now whether these were doubles, apparitions,
witches, or real persons, the witch family
in their carousal that night made much ado about
it, declaring to the company present that Bennett
Porter had shot at Jerusalem and had broken his
arm with the butlet.

have not told the half; but have presented
enough, to whieh others can testify, to enable the
reader to form some idea of the heinous thing,
and the horrors that our family had to endure
during the early settlement of Robertson county,
from an unknown enemy, and for an unknown
cause. Whether it was witchery, such as afflicted
people in past centuries and the darker ages,
whether some gifted fiend of hellish nature, practicing
sorcery for selfish enjoyment, or some more
modern science akin to that of mesmerism, or
some hobgoblin native to the wilds of the country,
ura disembodied soul sbut out from heaven,
or an evil spirit like those Paul drove out of the
man into the swine, setting them mad; ora demon
let loose from hell, I am unable to decide; nor
has any one yet divined its nature or cause for
appearing, and I trust this description of the
monster in all forms and shapes, and of many
tongues, will lead experts who may come with a
wiser gencration, to a correct conclusion and satisfactory
explanation.

However, no part of what I have written would
be complete without the finale; the climax which
IT now approach with a shudder that fills my
frame with horror, bringing fresh to memory
scenes and events that chilled the blood in my

young veins, cheating me out of twenty years of
life. It hangs over me like the pall of death, and
sends weary thoughtslike fleetingshadowsthrough
my brain, reviving in memory those demoniac
shrieks that came so oft from an invisible and
mysterious source, rending the air with vile and
hideous curses that drove me frantic with fear,
It is no ghastly dream of a fevered brain that
cones to haunt one's thoughts, but a sad, fearful
reality, a tremendous truth, that thrills the heart
with an unspeakable fear that no word painting
can portray on paper. Courageous men in battle
line may rush upon bristling bayonets and blazing
musketry, and face the. roaring cannon's
mouth, because they ean see the enemy and know
who and what they are fighting; but when it
comes to necting an unknown enemy of demonstrative
power, with gall upon its tongue and
venom in its bosom, heaving bitter curses and
breathing threatenings of dire consequences, which
one knows not of, nor can judge in what shape
or form the calamity is to come, the stoutest heart
will prove a coward, faltering and quivering with
painful fear. Why should my father, John Bell,
be inflicted with such a terrible curse? Why
should such a fate befall a man striving to live
uprightly? TI would be untrue to myself and my
-----File: 191.png---------------------------------------------------------
parentage, should I fail to state boldly that John
Bell was a man every inch of him and in every
sense of the term. No man was ever more faithful
and swift in the discharge of every duty, to
his family, to the church, to his neighbors, to his
fellow man, and to his God, in the fullness of his
capacity and that faith which led him to love
and accept Christ as a Savior. No mortal man
ever brought a charge of delinquency or dishonor
to his door. Not even the ghastly fiend that
haunted him to his death, in all of its vile curses
and evil threatenings, ever brought an accusation
against him, or uttered a solitary word that refloated
upon his honor, his character, his courage,
or his integrity. He lived in peace, and in the
enjoyment of the full confidence of his neighbors,
and Jacked not for scores of friends in his severest
trials. Then why this infliction? Where the
cause? Which nu man, saint, angel from heaven,
or demon from hell, has ever assigned. If there
was any hidden or unknown cause why he should
have thus suffered, or if it was in the providence
of God a natural consequence, then why shou'd
the torments of a demon have been visited upon
Elizabeth, who wasa girl of tender years, brought up
under the. careful training ef a, Christian mother,
and was free from guile and the wiles of the

wicked world, and innocent of all offense? Yet
this vile, heinous, unknown devil, torturer of
human flesh, that preyed upon the fears of people
like a ravenous vulture, spared not her, but rather
chose her as a shining mark for an exhibition of
its wicked stratagem and devilish tortures. And
never did it cease to practice upon her fears, insult
her modesty, stick pins in her body, pinching and
bruising her flesh, slapping her cheeks, disheveling
and tangling her hair, tormenting her in many
ways, until she surrendered that most cherished
hope which animates every young heart. Was
this the stratagem of a human genius skilled in
the black art; was it an enchantment, a freak in
destiny, or the natural consequence of disobedience
to some law in nature? Let a wiser head
than niine answer and explain the mystery.
Another problem in the development of these
mysterious manifestations, that has always puzzled
my understanding: Why should the husband
and father, the head of the family, and the
daughter, the pet and pride of the household, the
centre of all family affections, be selected to bear
the invections of this terrible visitation, while
demonstrations of the tenderest love from the
same source was hestowed upon the wife and
mother? If it was a living, intelligent creature,
-----File: 193.png---------------------------------------------------------
what could have been the dominating faculty of
its nature, that made this discrimination? Could
it have been an intelligent human devotion
springing from an emotional nature that could so
love the wife and mother, and cherish such bitter
enmity for her husband and offspring, both of
whom she loved most devotedly? Me thinks not;
only a fiend of a hellish nature, with poisoned
blood and seared conscience, if a conscience at all,
could have possessed such attributes. Yet we,
who experienced or witnessed the demonstration,
know that there was a wonderful power of intelligence,
possessing knowledge of men and things,
a spirit of divination, that could read ininds, tell
men's secrets, quote the Scriptures, 'repeat sermons,
sing hymns and songs, assume bedily
forms, and with all, an immence physical force
behind the manifestations.

Father continued to suffer widh spells as [have
already described, the jerking and twitching of
his face, and the swelling of his tongues, fearfully
distorting his whole physogmany. These spells
would last from one to two days, and after passing
off, he would be up and about his business,
apparently in strong robust health. As time
advanced the epells grew more frequent and
severe, and there was no periodical time for their

return, and along toward the last I stayed with
him all the time, especially when he left the
house, going with him wherever he went. The
witch also grew more angry and virulent in disposition.
Every word uttered to "Old Jack" was
a blast of curses and heinous threats, while to
mother, "Old Luce," it continued most tender,
loving and kind. About the middle of October
father had a very severe attack, which kept him
confined to the house six or eight days. The
witch cursed and raved like a maniac for several
days, and ceased not from troubling him. However,
he temporarily overcome this attack, and
was soon able to be out, though he would not
venture far from the house. But it was not destined
that he should enjoy a long respite. After
a week's recuperation he felt much stronger, and
called me very early one morning to go with him
to the hog pen, some three hundred yards from
the house, for the purpose of giving directions in
separating the porkers intended for fattening
from the stock hogs, We had not gone far before
one of his shoes was jerked off. I replaced it on
his foot, drawing the strings tight, tying a double
hard knot. After going a few steps farther, the
other shoe flew off in the same manner, which
was replaced and tied as in the case of the first.
-----File: 195.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WITCH. Ww
In no way that I could tie them would they hold,
notwithstanding his shoes fitted close and were a
little hard to put on, and we were walking over
asmooth, dry road. This worried him prodigiously;
nevertheless, he bore up strongly, and after
much delay and worry we reached the place, and
he gave directions, seeing the hogs properly separated
as he desired, and the hands left for other
work, and we started back for the house. We
had not gone many steps before his shoes commenced
jerking off as before, and presently he
complained of a blow on his face, which felt like
an open hand, that almost stunned him, and he
sat down on a log that lay by the road side.
Then his face commenced jerking with fearful
contortions, soon his whole body, and then his
shoes would fly off as fast as I could put them
on. The situation was trying and made me
shudder. I was terrified by the spectacle of the
contortions that seized father, as if to convert
him into a very demon toswallow me up. Having
finished tying father's shoes, I raised myself
up to hear the reviling sound of derisive songs
piercing the air with terrorizing force. As the
demoniac shrieks died away in triumphant rejoicing,
the spell passed off, and I saw the tears chasing
down father's yet quivering cheeks. The
-----File: 196.png---------------------------------------------------------

trace of faltering courage marked every lineament
of his face with a wearied expression of fading
hope. He turned to me with an expression of
tender, compassionate fatherly devotion, exclaiming
in a woful passionate tone, "Oh my son, my
son, not long will you have a futher to wait on
so patiently. I cannot much longer survive the
persecutions of this terrible thing. It is killing
me by slow tortures, and I feel that the end is
nigh." This expression sent a pang to my bosom
which I had never felt before. Mingled sorrow
and terror took possession of me and sent a tremor
through my frame that I can never forget. If
the earth could have opened and swallowed us
up, it would have been a joyful deliverance. My
heart bleeds now at every pore as I pen these
lines, refreshing my memory with thoughts of
the terror that possessed me then in anticipation
of a fearful tragedy that might be enacted before
father could move from his position. That moment
he turned his eyes upward and lifted his
soul to heaven in a burst of fervent passionate
prayer, such as I had never heard him utter
before. He prayed the Lord that if it were possible,
to let this terrible affliction pass. He beseeched
God to forsake him not in the trying
ordeal, but to give him courage to meet this un-*

known devastating enemy in the trying emergency,
and faith to lift him to the confidence and
love of a blessed Savior, and with all to relieve
his family and loved ones from the terrible afflictions
of this wicked, unknown, terrifying, blasphemous
agency. It wasin this strain that father
prayed, pouring out his soul in a passionate force
that seemed to take hold of Christ by a powerful
faith that afforded fresh courage and renewed
strength. After he had finished his prayer, a
feeling of calmness and reconciliation seemed to
possess him, and he appeared to have recovered
from the severeshock. The reviling songster had
disappeared, and he rose up remarking that he
felt better and believed he could walk to the
house, and he did, meeting with no more annoyance
as we proceeded on the way. However, he
took to his bed immediately on arriving at the
house, and though able to be up and down for
several weeks, he never left the house again, and
seemed all the while perfectly reconciled to the
terrible fate that awaited him. He gradually
declined; nothing that friends could do brought
any relief. Mother was almost constantly at his
bedside with all the devotion of her nature.
Brother John attended closely in the room, ministering
to him, and good neighbors were constant

in attendance. The witch was carrying on its
deviltry more or less all the while.

The crisis, however, came on the mornirg of
December 19th. Father, sick as he was, bad not
up to this time failed to awake at his regular
hour, according to his long custom, and arouse
the family. That morning he appeared to be
sleeping so soundly, mother quietly slipped out
of the room to superintend breakfast, while
brothers John and Drew looked after the farm
hands and feeding the stock, and would not allow,
him to be disturbed until after breakfast. Noticing
then that he was sleeping unnaturally, it was
thought best to awaken him, when it was discovered
that he was in a deep stupor, and could not
be aroused to any sensibility. Brother John
attended to giving him medicine, and went immediately
to the cupboard where he had carefully
put away the medicines prescribed for him, but
instead he found a smoky looking vial, which
was about one-third full of dark colored liquid.
He set up an inquiry at once to know who had
moved the medicine, and no one had touched it,
and neither could any one on the place give any
account of the vial. Dr. George Hopson, of Port
Royal, was sent for in great haste and soon arrived;
also neighbors Juhn Johnson, Alex. Gunn

and Frank Miles arrived early, and were there
when the vial was found. Kate, the witch, in
the meantime broke out with joyous exultatiop,
exclaiming, "It's useless for you to try to relieve
Old Jack, I have got him this time; he will never
get up from that bed again." Kate was then
asked about the vial of medicine found in the
cupboard, and replied, "I put it there, and gave
Old Jack a big dose out of it last night while he was
asleep, which fixed him." This was all the information
that could be drawn from the witch or
any other source concerning the vial of medicine.
Certain it was that no member of the family ever
saw it before, or could tell anything about it. In
fact no vial and no medicine of any kind had
been brought to the house by any one else except
by Dr. Hopson, and then it was handled carefully.
Dr. Hopson, on arrival, examined the
vial and said he did not leave it, and could not
tell what it contained. It was then suggested
that the contents be tested on something. Alex.
Gunn caught a eat, and Brother John run a
straw into the vial and drew it through the cat's
mouth, wiping the straw on its tongue. The cat
jumped and whirled over a few times, stretched
out, kicked, and died very quick. Father lay all
day and night in a deep stupor, as if under the

influence of some opiate, and could not be aroused
to take any medicine. The Doctor said he could
dstect something on his breath that smelt very
much like the contents of the vial which he had
examined. How father could have gotten it was
a mystery that could not be explained in any
other way except that testified by the witch.
The vial and contents was thrown into the fire,
and instantly a blue blaze shot up the chimney
like a flash of powder. Father never revived or
returned to consciousness for a single moment,
He lingered along through the day and night,
gradually wearing away, and on the morning of
December 20th, 1820, breathed his last. Kate
was around during the time, indulging in wild
exultations and derisive songs. After father
breathed his last. nothing more was heard from
Kate until after the burial was completed. It
was a bright December day and 4 great crowd of
people came to attend the funeral. Rev. Suge
Fort and Revs. James and Thomas Gunu conducted
the services. After the grave was filled,
and the friends turned to leave the sad scene, the
witch broke out in a loud voice singing, "Row me
up some brandy O," and continued singing this
until the family and friends had all entered the
house. And thus ended one chapter in the series
-----File: 203.png---------------------------------------------------------
of exciting and frightful events that kept the
whole neighborhood so long in a frenzy, and
worked upon our fears from day to day.

Kate's Departure and Return After Seven Years.

After the death of John Bell, Sr., the fury of
the witch was greatly abated. There were but
two purposes, seemingly, developed in the visitation.
One was the persecution of father to the
end of his life. The other the vile purpose of
destroying the anticipated happiness that thrilled
the heart of Betsy. This latter purpose, however,
was not so openly inanifested as the first, and
was of such a delicate nature that it was
kept a secret as much as possible in the family
and ignored when talked about. But it never
ceased its tormenting until her young dream was
destroyed. The witch remained with us after
father's death through the Wm.er and Spring of
1821, all the while diminishing or becoming less
demonstrative. Finally it took leave of the family,
bidding mother, "Luce," an affectionate fare-well,
saying that it would be-absent seven years,
but would surely return to see us and would then
visit every house in the neighborhood. This
promise was fulfilled as regards the old homestead,
but I do not know that it visited other
-----File: 204.png---------------------------------------------------------
184 THE BELL WITCH.

homes in the vicinity. It returned during February,
1828. The family was then nearly broken
up. Mother, Joel and myself were the only occupants
left at the old homestead, the other members
of the family having scttled off to themselves.
The demonstrations announcing its return were
precisely the same that characterized its first
appearance. Jod occupied a bed in mother's
room, and I slept in another apartment alone.
After considerable scratching on the weatherboarding
on the outside, it appeared in the same
way on the inside, scratching on the bed post and
pulling the cover from my bed as fast as I could
replace it, keeping me up nearly all night. It
went on in this way for several nights, and I
spoke not a word about it, lest I should frighten
mother. However, one night later, after worrying
me for some time, [heard a noise in mother's
room, and knew at once what was te pay. Very
soon mother and Joel came rushing into my
room, much frightened, telling me about the disturbance
and something pulling the cover off.
We sat up till a late hour discussing the matter,
satisfied that it was the same old Kate, and agreed
not to talk to the witch, and that we would keep
the matter a profound secret to ourselves, worrying
with it the best we could, hoping that it would
-----File: 205.png---------------------------------------------------------
soon leave, as it did, after disturbing us in this
way some two weeks, and this was my last experience
with Kate. The witch came and went,
hundreds of people witnessed its wonderful demonstrations,
and many of the best people of Robertson
and adjoining eountics have testified to
these facts, telling the story over and over to the
younger gencration, and for this and other reasons
as before stated I have written this much
of the details as correctly as it is possible to state
the exciting events. So far nu one has ever given
any intelligent or comprehensive explanation of
the great mystery. Those who came as experts
were worse confounded than ail others. As I
before stated, a few mendacious calumniators
were mean enough to charge that it was tricks
and inventions of the Bell family to make money,
and I write for the purpose of branding this version
asan infamous falseliood. It was well known
in the vicinity and all over the county that every
investigation confirned the fact that the Bell
family were the greatest, if not the only sufferers
from the visitation, and that no one. or a dozen
persons in collusion, could have so leng, reguluarly
and persistently practiced such a fraud
without detection, nor could they have known
the minds and secrets of strangers visiting the
-----File: 206.png---------------------------------------------------------
186 THE BELL WITCH.

place, and detailed events that were then occuring
or had just transpired in different localities.
Moreover the visitation entailed great sacrifice.
As to how long this palavering phenomenon continued
in the vicinity, I am unable to state. It
did not disturb the remaining members of the
family at the old place any more. Mother died
shortly after this and the house was entirely
deserted, the Jand and other property being
divided among the heirs. The old house stood
for some years and was used for storing grain
and other farm products, and was finally torn
down and moved away. Many persons professed
to have seen sights and heard strange sounds
about the old house and in the vicinity all along
up to this day. Several have described to me
flitting lights along the old lane and through the
farm, while others profess to have heard sounds
of wonderfully sweet music and strange voices
ullering indistinct words. And it is said that
such things have been seen and heard at various
places in the neighborhood, but F have no personal
knowledge of the facts.

The death of John Bell, Sr, left «a shadow of
iinpenetrabie gloom hanging like the pall of darkness
over the sorrow stricken family. They were
asa ship without a rudder; no solace for anguish
and no light penetrating the darkness of the
future, or forecasting the end of this great family
affliction, save that the witch was now less virulent
in its demonstrations, ceasing to torment
Betsy as it had before. The only way open was
in pursuing the even tenor of life, awaiting the
further developments of the unknown destroyer
of the peace of the happy household. The death
of Mr, Bell and the manner of his taking off
awakened another sensation, one of a more serious
and solemn import than all the events in the
varied chapter of sensations which had so Jong

kept the community in a state of frenzy, galling
into exercise every faculty and all the stratagems
of inventive genius, in the effort to detect the
mysterious agency, only to be foiled and involved
in still greater confusion. The phenomena had
progressed, developing new features, power and
character from week to week, finally fulfilling
that malignant purpose declared in the outset to
he a part of its mission, that of tormenting "Old
Jack Bell" out of his life by a slow process of
mysterious torture, and now all eyes and thoughts
centered on Betsy, curiously wondering and discussing
with animetion the probable effect of the
death of the father upon the daughter, and the
attitude of the witch towards her. The girl was
then overwhelined with grief for the loss of a
devoted father, which in the course of time was
to be overcome, but the forebodings of the horrible
witch, whose caprice tuight chasten her
through Jife. or burst at any moment in the malignity
of volcanie wrath, hung over her like an
impending calamity, menacing the happiness of
life wih bitter anguish. The suspense was dreadful

good offices, visiting and ministering comfort to
the distressed family, and much to the surprise
and gratification of all, there appeared a remarkable
change in the mordacity of Kate toward
Betsy. The haunting sphinx ceased harrassing
and becoie a ministering spirit, manifesting more
sympathy and tender compassion than all the
friends who sought her on that gracious mission,
save perhaps one. Joshua Gardner was never
reniiss in his devotions, and he labored with all
the earnestness of his soul to remove the cloud
that shadowed her happiness, and his efforts were
not without good effect, notwithstanding his presence
was attended with the premonition, of Kate's
abhorent augury. Betsy Bell was conscious that
her heart beat in unison of sympathy for that
manly devotion su freely bestowed on her. But
what would be the consequence if she should disregard
the warnings of her wicked tormentor,
whose inflictions were already as great as could
be endured? Might not the terrible freak execute
its threats on her, as it had fulfilled the prophecy
concerning her father, and destroy the peace and
happiness of both herself and lover, rendering
them miserable for life, should she yield to his
entreaty and become his wife? Such were her
thoughts and reasoning against the inclination of
-----File: 212.png---------------------------------------------------------
190 THE BELL WITCH.

her cherished desire, and it was a most difficult
problem to solve, in the struggle of the heart between
Jove and fear. Kate had ceased meddling
in the affair, never called Joshua's name to Betsy,
nor spoke when he was present. This relenting
was encouraging to the lovers, and Joshua took
advantage of the circumstance as evidence that
the trouble was nearing the end, and pressed his
suit, urging that the marriage should take place
at an early date, when they might leave the
haunted vale for their contemplated Western
home. entering connubial life amid happier scenes
full of new inspiration, and hearts thrilled with
the joys they had so long anticipated. Betsy was
disposed to yield to his prosuasive reasoning:
Joshua had drawn a different pieture of the future
from that which she had been looking upon. It
was full of promise and stimulated renewed hope,
and she gave her consent, conditionally, insisting
that the matter be postponed a while longer,
awaiting further developments in the witeh's
course, which were to be expected soon. There
was, however, no more malevolent manifestations.
Kate had almost ceased annoying the family,
which served to give coloring to the rainbow of
promise which Joshua painted so beautifully, and
Betsy soon found her crushed hope reviving,
-----File: 213.png---------------------------------------------------------
animating her broken spirit. The flush returned
to her paled cheeks, a brighter lustre filled her
pretty blue eyes, while a mischievous smile returned
to play in the light of those matchless
orbs.

This change in Betsy was noticed by all
comers and goers, and was the gossip of the neighborhood.
The Fairy Queen of the Haunted Dale
was herself again. The gloom of despond had
passed away, and a happy heart revealed itself in
her sparkling eyes and merry laughter, which
scemed to defv Kate, and the witch had ceased to
interpose any further impediment to the match,
and the brilliant wedding long anticipated was
conceded to be close at hand. The Rell home
had resumed something of its former gayety and
splendid hospitatity. extending a hearty welcome
to all who came, offering the greatest attraction
to visitors known in the country, and Betsy's
grace of manners, pleasing conversation and
charming wit, combined with her personal beauty,
was a source of pleasure that all, old and young,
delighted in.

She was the joy of the home,
The pride of the vale:

Her presence like sunshine
That lights up the dale.

Easter Monday.

Easter came in all the glory of ethereal April.
Nature had put on its spring garb unusually early,
and the day was like the resurrection morn, lending
inspiration and vigor to all that was flush
with life. The afternoon found a gay party of
young people assembled at the Bell home, as by
intuition, to arrange plans for the outing and pastime
for the to-morrow, Easter Monday being a
holiday observed by all people, even the servants
being exempted from regular duty and allowed
freedom to spend the day as they wished. A
fishing excursion and a hunt for wild flowers
along the river bluff seemed to promise the greatest
diversion, and it was agreed upon to meet at
Brown's for the sport. The day dawned with a
clear sky, and the sun rose in all of her splendor,
sending forth gentle rays to kiss away the morning
dew. The full blown orchard that almost
surrounded the Bell residence presented a living
bouquet of nature's beauty, white and pink
blooms nestling amid the fresh young foliage of
the trees, mingling their sweet perfumes on the
gentle current that swept over the valley. Three
interesting couples left the Bell place that morning
for a stroll through the orchard and across
-----File: 215.png---------------------------------------------------------
the meadow to the river side, where the fishing
party was expected to meet. The three couples
were Betsy Bell and her lover, Joshua Gardner,
Theny Thorn and Alex. Gooch, and Rebecca
Porter and James Long. Three happier couples
never started out for a glorious holiday. Betsy
had acceded to Joshua's proposition, dismissing
all gloomy forebodings, and that morning for the
first time wore a beautiful engagement ring,
which Joshua placed on her finger Easter morning,
while sitting beneath the favorite pear tree,
and she started out with a light and joyous heart,
full of mirthful sport, making merry the day.
"See there girls," exclaimed Betsy, "those beautiful
pear trees, arrayed in white, representing the
bride of the morning. They bow to us a hearty
welcome this lovely holiday." 'Yes, I see," returned
Theny Thorn, "they are perfectly lovely;
but you overlook the peach trees on the other side
of the path, dressed in pink. They represent the
bridesmaids." "Well," observed Becky Porter,
"T should like to know what these pretty little
violets represent which you all are unconsciously
mashing under your big feet?" "They are Cupid's
arrows," answered Joshua Gardner. "They cannot
be crushed by trampling, Miss Becky; see
how quick they rise up, smiling sweetly." "Yes,"
-----File: 216.png---------------------------------------------------------
194 THE BELL WITCH.

exclaimed Betsy, "that is why I love them so
much; break or bruise one, and it comes again as
fresh as ever." Alex. Giooch presumed that these
sentimental expressions were inspired by the invigorating
morning breeze. "Please, Miss Betsy,
what does this refreshing zephyr, which blows
such a pleasant gale, represent in your beautiful
Easter picture?" "Oh, that is the breath of the
bridegroom," laughingly answered--Betsy."
"Then," observed James Long, "if we are to judge
from the fragrance of his breath, the bridegroom
must be a distiller, out gathering nectar from the
myriads of sweet blossoms, that excites so much
felicitous exultation.' "Yes, Mr. Long," replicd
Becky, "you have a correct appreciation of the
work of nature's God; you observe that the sunbeams
come first, gathering dewdrops from the
precious buds, giving off the perfume to the morning's
breath; that is what Betsy refers to." "Oh,
pshaw," ejaculated Alex. Gooch, "please all hold
up a bit and find your equilibrium. We started
out to go fishing, but you girls are about to turn
to fairies and take wings on the morning air."
"Yes, yes," exclaimed Joshua, "lets go fishing;
why linger here. Look yonder, see those majestic
trees that line the river bank, lifting up their
leafy boughs in solid phalanx like a bordering
-----File: 217.png---------------------------------------------------------
mountain range of evergreen, keeping sentry over
this lovely valley. See how gracefully their waving
tops beckon us on to catch the sweet strains
of the warbling birds that are mingling their
melody with the soft sighing winds and the murmuring
waves that are surging by." "Hold up,
hold up two minntes, Joshua; catch your breath
and take a fresh start," exclaimed Alex. Gooch.
"Oh, no," interposed James Long, "let Josh gush.
He is in ecstacy of mind this morning, which
eccounts for his poetical flights." "Well, said
Miss Theny, "I am not going to leave here without
a bouquet of Cupid's arrows. Come Becky,
let's you and I load up with violets and peach
blossoms, while Josh and Betsy are taking down
that+pear tree." Thus run the conversation in
sallies of pleasantry and flights of fancy, as the
three joyous couples wended their way through
the orchard and across the green meadow to the
river side, where many happy souls had already
gathered and were making the best of the bright
morning, entering fully into the frolicsome sports
of the day.

Prof. Powell's School.
Very soon Prof. Richard Powell put in an appearance,
just out from Springfield on his first
canvass for the Legislature. He had heard some-*

thing about the fishing party, and could not resist
the temptation to call by, and mingle a short
while with the happy throng of youngsters who
had grown up under his tutorage. His presence
was the signal for a general rush to the circle that
was gathering around the handsome teacher who,
though a bachelor, maintained his youthful appearance,
good humor and fascinating manners,
extending hearty grectings and happy congratulations.
"How good it is to be here," exclaimed
the Professor; "it carries me back to our joyous
school days, when you were all happy rollicking
children, and I was well--I was one of you."
"We are all children yet," answered Joshua Gardner,
"and I move that we open school right here
and now." "Good," said Alex. Gooch, "Fam in
for that." "And we will have some fun turning
out the teacher," remarked Jimmie Long. "No
you won't," returned Betsy, "we girls will take
Mr. Powell's part and tur you boys in for the
ducking. What say you girls? All in favor of
that motion hold up your strong right hand."
"Both hands," exclaimed Theny, and all hands
went up. "There now boys," observed the Professor,
"I have the advantage this time, and will
not go into the river to-day. Betsy you are just
the same sweet good girl you always were, taking

my part against the boys, and you too, Theny,
Beeky, Betsy Gunn, Nicie Gooch, Mary Gorham,
Sarah Batts; yes, and you too, Mahalia, Susan,
Nancy, every one of those dear little hands; you
are all my pets and sweethearts, and I am going
to stand by you girls, as long as I live. Tf you
should happen to marry these bad boys, and they
don't treat you right, any of you, just call on me,
and I will help to turn him outand put his head
under the spring spout." "Ha, ha," laughed
Drew Bell, "I am going to be a girl to-day and
help the Professor; put Calvin Johnson and Frank
Miles under the spout, they have no business in
this crowd anyway; they ought to be looking after
some old girls." "And where ought you to be,
Drew? I just came down here thinking I would
bait my hook with you for a catfish." "No, no,
Mr. Miles," exclaimed Betsy Gunn, "we can't
spare Mr. Drew; he digs our fish bait; look at his
hands." "Hold up hands, Drew," cried Calvin
Johnson; "if you are going to be a girl, hold up
them hands." "I shan't," said Drew. "Oh yes,
Drew," insisted the Professor, "you have elegant
hands." "You meanelephant hands, Mr. Powell,"
returned Frank Miles." "No, grubbing hoes,"
said another. "Fiatboat oars,' put in Alex.

Becky Porter, "Mr. Drew can dig more fish bait
than all of you, and we can't get along without
him: on Easter Monday." "Why Becky," whispered
Mary, "T guess you can get J. Long just
as well." "Now Mary, that's a good pun; what a
witty Bell you might be," retoried Becky.
"Please, Professor, excuse brother Drew from
holding up his hands, he hasn't washed them
to-day," pleaded Betsy. "Drew you will be excused,
now finish digging bait; go to the spring
and wash your hands, and then come to books,
and fetch your Gunn to keep bad boys like Frank
Miles off? Thus an hour passed in the exchange
af pleasantry, witticisms, congratulations, repartee
and general hilarity, recounting amusing events
that oceurred during school days, Mr. Powell
declaring that it was the happiest hour he had
spent since he had left the neighborhood, and he
was very sorry that he could not spend the day
in such pleasant company, but that he was
obliged to leave, and wishing all much good luck
in the catch of the day, he was off; not, however,
without paying Betsy Bell some special compliments,
telling her that she had grown up to be
more beautiful and charming than he had ever
dreamed of when he used to pet her so much.
"Just as I always told your mother, Miss Betsy,
-----File: 223.png---------------------------------------------------------
that you were the brightest and smartest girl in
school, when she declared I would spoil you; but
I did not, did 1?" "I think not, Professor; I
hope I don't act like a spoiit girl," returned
Betsy. "No you do not, Josh will bear me out
in that. And by the way, Josh is a fine fellow;
I have heard that you and Josh were about to
make a match, and I shall wish you much happiness
and prosperity. That boy never could
help loving you, and I never did blame him, as
you were my little pet also, and I have waited
almost as patiently as did Jacob for Rachel,
hoping that you and Josh might forget that
young school day love, but I have been disappointed,
and now my request is to be at the wedding.
I want to be present when you wéd, my
little pet. Good-bye, I wish you well." "Professor,
I shall let you know when that happens,"
answered Betsy. As soon as Mr. Powell left, the
assembly broke up in couples, stringing out along
the river bank wherever good places could be
found to throw in their hooks. The darkies in
the country were all out early for the holiday,
and had monopolized the river bank from Brown's
ford up to Gorham's mill, and the young people
respecting their rights too much to disturb their
pleasure, sought places below the ford, the three

couples from the Bell home being last to locate,
Joshua and Betsy taking the last position, just
opposite the enchanted spring where the treasure
trove was said to be concealed, which was a fair
open spot. Mr. Gardner soon baited the hooks
and set the poles in the bank to await the coming
of the fish, and he and Betsy seated themselves
on a green sward back upon the hill side over-looking
the fishing-tackle. The sky continued
clear, and the sun approached noontide, spreading
bright rays over the valley, while a brisk
wind heavily freighted with sweetest fragrance
swept over, keeping the fresh green foliage of the
tall tress along the river side in constant commotion.
The modest little brook from the enchanted
spring rippled down the river bank in sweet consonance
with the murmuring waves that rolled
steadily by. The merry laughter of the gay
throng strung out along the brink was caught up
by the breeze in chorus with the musie of the
happy wildwood songsters that fluttered, chirped
and twittered in the boughs overhead. It was indeed
a real Easter day--the goddess of Spring
restoring to nature that refreshing and renewal
of life which so beautifully commemorates the
resurrection of the world's Savior. Even the
finny tribe seemed mindful of the commemora-*
-----File: 225.png---------------------------------------------------------
tive event and were on a holiday frolic, coming
to the top, jumping and flounciny on the bosom
of the crystal-like waves, and didn't care a fig for
the daintiest bait thrown out by eager fishermen.
"Keep less noise down there, you frighten the
fish away," velled a stentorian voice in a commanding
tone. "You are keeping more noise,
Mr. Miles, than all of us," exclaimed Betsy Gunn.
"Yes, but I have got to roar to get you youngsters
settled so T can eatch fish. Now you and John
Bell settle down to the business you came here
for, like Josh and Betsy, I came to catch fish,"
returned Mr. Miles. 'So did we," observed John,
"but we have no idea of scaring them to death."
"That is just what you are doing; see how they
jump," replied William Porter; "Frank and I
caine here to catch some fish if you chaps will
keep less noise." "Then you will have to jump
in an run them down, Brother Billy," exclaimed
Becky Porter.

Uncle Zeke's Rectification Ov Dem Ghostes.
Uncle Zeke, a consequential old darkey, who
was very proud of the honor of being special valet
to Rev. Thomas Gunn, occupied a position just
above, to the right of Frank Miles, inquiringly
put the question: "Mars Frank, kin I hab der

Uncle Zeke, what is it?" "Well sar, Ize bin

it is by instinct or jar from the vibration of sound

story about the naming of this river which beats
that. The story is that Moses Renfroe, who
brought the first white settlement to this river,
himself and all of his people were slaughtered by
the Indians. The savage brutes dragged the

men, women and children to the river, scalped
their heads and cut their throats, throwing their
bodies in, causing the water to run red with
blood, and the stream was after that called Red
River. That is what I understand about it,
Uncle Zeke, but go on with your story about the
spirit." "Well sar, dats all der same; ez I war

Jaughed heartily at the idea, and told Uncle Zeke
that his conclusions were no doubt correct. During
all this interval, while time was swiftly passing,
Joshua Gardner and Betsy Bell had not
thought of their fishing-tackle. They continued
to occupy the velvety stratum first selected for a
seat, oblivious to the merriment of their frolicsome
friends, and all the passing events that lent
gayety tothe occasion, Prof. Powell had observed
that Betsy was wearing an engagement ring, and
it was no doubt the sight of this token of a betrothal
that inspired his remarks on taking leave
of his "pet" that morning; and this was
the subject that absorbed the thoughts of
the lovers. They were discussing the wedding
day, the far away home in the West that should
soon give them welcome; the new scene that the
change would bring, and the joys that awaited
to bless their union. They were given entirely
to the revery of their own sweet dreams, bestowing
no attention upon the surrounding charms.
They took no notice of the finny tribe that played
upon the rolling waves in sight, nor to the rip-*

pling of the wandering brook that gushed wildly
down the hill from the foaming fountain above.
Nor were they attracted by the warbling strains
of the birds in the rustling boughs overhead, or
interested in any of these things which afforded
so much pleasure to other members of the company.
They longed for the holly, for love's own
sweet holin in the faraway West, where they had
For Cupid built a flowery castle,
Stored with manna of pure love,

The Phantom Fish.

Presently the sound of a mighty splashing was
heard upon the waters which attracted all attention.
A great fish had seized Joshua Gardner's
hook with such force that it jerked the pole from
the bank, and dashed off up stream, slashing the
waves furiously as it rose to the top, flouncing
and fluttering with great rage, and then diving
to the bottom, carrying the pole under also, and
instantly rising with a spurt, rushing in wild confusion
to the south bank, as if it meant to leap
for the land, but just at the water's edge it darted
under, bounding up stream with the pole trolling
behind, between the bank and the hooks thrown
out by the eager fishermen along the stream.
-----File: 231.png---------------------------------------------------------
Passing under Uncle Zeke's tackle, the big swimmer
flounced again to the top, making a hurry-skurry
circle, tangling the old darkies' lines with
the pole, and taking another straight shoot up
the river. Before Uncle Zeke could recover
from the confusion, one of his poles had joined in
the procession, and he was bewildered with excitement.
"Why don't you jump in, Uncle Zeke,
and catch that fish and save your pole? Don't
you see the fish is hung, and you are a good
swimmer? Go quick, jump, plunge, and bring
in the biggest fish ever caught in Red River,"
wildly shouted Frank Miles. This speech fired
Uncle Zeke's courage to the highest pitch. He
lost his head, and forgot all about the "Injun"
spirit for the moment, and in less than a half
minute had pulled off his coat and shoes and was
in the act of jumping head-foremost into the
river. But a precaution struck him, and he
called a halt, carefully stepping one foot in the
water, which he quickly jerked back with a
shudder, and exclaiming, "I aint gwine dar; Ize
done had er sentment bout dat fish, cepen hits
gwinter fool me.' "Oh go ahead, Uncle Zeke,
don't be so cowardly; you belong to Parson Gunn,
and what's the difference if you shou:d drown,
you will go straight to heaven," urged Mr. Miles.
-----File: 232.png---------------------------------------------------------
208 THE BELL WITCH.

"Dats so, Mars Frank, I haint carin' nuffin bout
drownin, but den whose gwinter tend tu Mars
Toms hoss like I does, and whose gwinter brush
hiz coat and hat an black his shoes? Kase dar
aint nary nudder nigger dar dat knows howter
mix der lampblack; dats what pesters me by der
sentment." In the meanwhile a more youthful
and daring darkey, a little higher up, heard Mr.
Miles' suggestion and plunged in, swimming to
the poles that were still bobbing up and down in
the water, and as he grabbed the main pole, the
fish made a circle, tightening the line, and whirling
the negro around in the water, as it made
another dash for the bank, helping the darkey to
swim with greater ease and spel. But just as
he reached the shore, and the excited crowd had
gathered to help land the catch, the great fish
flounced to the top, releasing itself, and was gone
dashing up stream. splitting the waves, amid the
shouts of excited fishermen nearly up to Gorham's
mill. Now an excited discussion turned
upon the anties of the monster acquatic, it size,
to which family of the finny tribe it belonged,
One thought it was an "eel," another said "catfish,"
another said a shark had wandered up the
stream. Frank Miles declared that it was the
biggest trout ever seen, but all agreed that the
-----File: 233.png---------------------------------------------------------
great finny was between two and three feet in
length. William Porter observed that they had
all better get to their places and bait their hooks;
that the fish might return soon. The suggestion
was sufficient, and pretty soon quiet was restored,
every one giving strict attention to fishing. But
Uncle Zeke could not suppress the inclination to
whisper to Frank Miles, "I tole yer so. I sed
sumpin war gwinter happen." Joshua and Betsy
had been attracted from their delightful repose
by the prevailing excitement, but as soon as the
big finny made its escape, they returned to the
beautiful sward, ostensibly to look after the
remaining fishing-tackle. Betsy, however, did
not seem so gay and happy as she had appeared
all the morning, and frankly confessed to her
lover strange forebodings that depressed her feelings,
but she could not explain the cause. Joshua
then devoted his efforts to dispelling the gloom,
as he had before done, and at the moment he had
quite well succeeded, when the reverberating
sound of ecstatic voices above were heard in wild
exclaim, "Look out, look out, its coming back!"
The breaking waves and the furious lashing of
the water told the story, that the playful fish was
on its return down stream, riding upon the tide,
a3 if to catch the sunbeams that glittered upon

the foamy crest. It, however, quickly disappeared,
and all was quiet, every fisherman anxiously
watching for a bite.

The Lovers' Forcbodings.

The dying excitement of the last appearance
left the lovers in a reverie of their own thoughts,
deeply meditating upon their contemplated plans,
as if trying to penetrate a shadow that secmed to
hang heavily over their destiny, in spite of all
efforts to rise above the crest of the cloud by looking
all the while at the bright side.. The suspense
was painful, but nothing to compare with the
sound of Kate's familiar voice which immediately
pierced their ears like the bursting of a thunder
cloud, pleading in that same old plaintive tone,
"Please Betsy Bell, don't have Joshua Gardner,"
repeating the entreaty over and over, until the
lovers were overwhelmed with dismay, when the
melancholy voice died away gradually as the
waves rolled by and were lost to sight with the
passing current. The color faded from the poor
girl's cheeks as quickly as if a dagger had pierced
her bosom, and Joshua, though courageous as he
had proven before on similar occasions, felt the
pangs of a broken heart, and was powerless to
sooth the anguish that told so plainly on his
-----File: 235.png---------------------------------------------------------
affianced. They sat motionless and speechless
for some minutes, as if awaiting an awful doom.
At last Betsy broke the silence, proposing a walk
up the hillside to the spring for a drink of water.
There they drank and discoursed on the excellency
of the cooling draught, the beauty of the
foaming bubbles that broke away in diminutive
billows rushing with the trickling 'stream down
the cragy hillside, then gathering a few wild
flowers, and thus they whiled away some twenty
minutes in an effort to dispell the gloomy forebodings
and regain composure, but all was in
vain. Finally Betsy summoned the courage of
her convictions, telling Joshua frankly that her
mind was made up, and that she could not brook
the storm which treatened all the fancied happiness
which seemed to be in store for them; that
she was now clearly convinced that her tormenter
would follow her through life with an appalling
destiny, should she resist its importunities and
dire threatenings, just as it had already afflicted
her, and brought her father to suffering and unto
death. Even were she able to endure it all, her
compliance with his wish would be injustice to
him, and a wrong for which she could never expect
forgiveness. Therefore she desired to withdraw
her promise and return to him the engage-*

ment ring which she prized so highly. Joshua
Gardner was suffering the bitterest anguish that
ever pierced a heart. He had never known before
the strength of his passion forthe queenly beauty
who stood before him in the perfection of lovely
young womanhood, conscious that the stern
decision had cost her as much pain as it did him.
and was rendered as a sacrifice for his own well-fare,
as she conceived. He tried to plead his
cause anew, but was so overwhelmed with the
force of her reasoning and firmness of decision
that he for the first time faltered, realizing that
all hope was vain, and that every plea but added
another sorrow to a bleeding heart. and a fresh
pang to his own, and he gracefully aceepted the
inevitable, begging her tu keep the ring in memory
of one who loved her dearer than his own
own life. This she declined to do, telling him
that the ring was a seal to her solemn vow, and
the vow could not be broken in the sight of
heaven. unless he would accept the return of the
ring. 'I could not." she said, vretain it without
retaining the thorn that new pierces my heart,
and I know Joshua that you are too generous
not to accede to my wish." Slipping it from her
finger as she held out her hand. Joshua Gardner
in all the bitter anguish of a broken heart, ex-*

claimed, "Betsy, my love, the adoration of my
soul, the long hope of my life, this is the bitterest
draught of all, but for your sake I drink to the
dregs, releasing you from the promise which I
know was earnest." Thus ended the affair in
which the witch had manifested so much interest
from the commencement of the "Family Trouble."
Very soon the three couples retraced their steps
across the valley to the Bell home, an.id the gay
scenes of nature in the full flush of jovous Spring,
but the walk was not attended by that levity and
buoyancy of spirit which characterized the morning
stroll. Ail were conscious of the shadow
which hung so heavily over Betsy, depressing her
happy spirit, and which had that day sent another
poisonous shaft quivering to her bleeding heart,
and the bowed form and dejected spirit of Joshua
Gardner. which told plainly that he too carried
acrushed heart in his manly bosom, and all hearts
were touched too deep with burning sympathy
to admit of any alacrity. It was more like going
toa funeral, and the accompanying couples kept
a respectful distance in the rear, discussing as
they walked leisurely along the appaling sorrow
which the return of the witch had brought that
day. The lovers separated that afternoon never
to meet again. A few days later, as soon as he

could arrange his affairs, Joshua Gardner took his
departure, some days' journey to the west, and
settled in West Tennessee, the place now known
as Gardner's Station, Obion county, where he
passed a long and honorable career, esteemed by
the people for his true manhood and moral
worth. Hedied several years ago at the advanced
age of eighty-four years.
The weird fiend, cast the scene,
Lurid with the seer's blight,
And hope forlorn, shadowed the morn
With the gloom of night.
Thus the sequal. young love unequal
To the wizard's subtle art.
And dreamers await, thehand of fate,
While despondency sears the heart.
'The lovers parted, weary, broken-hearted,
Cruel fate coming between,
The blasting frost, the appalling ghost,
Chilled the bower of green.
The flowers withered, the castle quivered
When Cupid tled the scene.
And the beautiful tower, lovers bower
Became a fading. crumbling sheen.
Seizing the wreck, scuttling the deck
Witches vaunted gholish spleen,
The vile freak, with exulting shriek
Cavorted the dale unseen.
The jack-o-lantern glare, flitted the air,
O'er the valley of doom,
And the pall of night, shadowed beacon light
Filling the vale with gloom.
Down the bill, and o'er the rill
Horrid spirits delighted to prowl,
-----File: 239.png---------------------------------------------------------
The piercing thrill, of whippoor-will,
Giving place to the hooting owl.
From the mill, and old still
Came songs of the weird,
Voices shrill, with horrible trill
Hushinug the joyous mocking bird.
The old pear tree, hoary it be,
Still shadows the happy scene,
Spreading its boughs, over the vows
Witnessed beneath its greén.
Where lovers plighted, hearts united,
The vows they would redeem,
And continues weeping, lovers sleeping,
For the return of the dream.

The witch exulted freely over the victory won,
but troubled Betsy no more; rather tried to soothe
and strengthen her depressed spirit, promising to
leave soon, as it did, bidding the family good-bye.

Several Weddings.

Some months later a brilliant wedding took
place at the residence of James Johnson. The
whole community gathered in to celebrate the
nuptials which united Theny Thorn and Alex.
Gooch. Six months after this affair, James Long
and Rebecca Porter were happily wedded. Both
couples settled in the Bell neighborhood, sharing
the burdens of good citizenship, and their descendants
still reside in that community, worthily sustaining
the honored names inherited, ranking
among the best people of the county. Next fol-*

lowed the marriage of John Bell, Jr., and Elizabeth
Gunn, whose bonorable career and success
in Hfe is recorded in the family biography. It
wasa long while before Betsy Bell could overcome
the shock of that notable Easter Monday in April,
1821. whieh almost extinguished that effervesence
which had characterized her girlhood, Vivacious
as she was, it was difficult for her to conceal the
depression that had so long menaced her young
life and overwhelmed her on that memorial day.
Some while after this, however, the Professor,
Hon. Richard Powell, became her persistent suitor
and was finally accepted, and in this she kept her
promise that the Professor should be at the wedding.
Richard Powell was many years her senior,
but was a handsome gentleman of elegant manners,
and bore an honorable name and reputation.
He was in fact a leading character and politician,
represented the county several times, or as long
as he desired, in the State Legislature, which was
then considered a very high honor. He was also
prominent in all public affairs, and one of the
most popular men in Robertson county. Their
married life was coniparatively short, about seventeen
years. Mr. Powell died, and Betsy remained
a widow the balance of her life. About
1875 she moved to Mississippi, where one of her
-----File: 241.png---------------------------------------------------------
children and other relatives resided, and died in
1890 at the age of eighty-six years. She has
grand-children still living in Robertson county,
who have inherited that vivacity and charming
wit which echaricterized her young life. After
mature years, Mrs. Powell becaine a large fleshy
woman, and physically very stout. She was high
spirited and noted through life for her industrious
habits, good nature, and splendid social qualities,
always entertaining in any circle. The fearful
thing known as "The Family Trouble", so called
to this day by the descendants, was the plague
of her life. She had borne with great fortitude
and womanly courage the afflictions visited upon
her, but the story sect afloat by parties failing in
their investigations, charging her with the authorship
of the mystery, after she had submitted to
all manner of tests, was crushing to her strong
spirit, yet she murmured not, hoping to live down
the misrepresentation, and that her innocence
would be demonstrated to all intelligent reasonable
people, and so it was to the people of Robertson
county, acquainted with the facts, but a
riischievous lie once set afloat travels far beyond
the reach of truth. So it was in her case; wherever
the story of the witeh bad gone anong
strangers, her name has been coupled with it as
-----File: 242.png---------------------------------------------------------
218 THE BELL WITCH.

the autnor of those most wonderful demonstrations,
and all through her long life the story was
frequently revived, which to her was like a canker-worm
that never ceased torturing; and still she
endured it patiently. However, the time came
when patience ceased to bea virtue. About 1849
the Saturday Evening Post, published either at
Philadelphia or New York, printed a long sketch
of the Bell Witch phenomenon, written by a
reporter who made a strenuous effort in the details
to connect her with the authorship of the demonstrations.
Mrs. Powell was so outraged by the
publication that she engaged a lawyer to institute
suit for libel. The matter, however, was settled
without litigation, the paper retracting the charges,
explaining how this version of the story had
gained credence, and the fact that at the time the
demonstrations commenced Betsy Bell had
scarcely advanced from the stage of childhood
and was too young to have been capable of originating
and practicing so great a deception. The
fact also that after this report had gained cireulation,
she had submitted to any and every test
that the wits of detectives could invent to prove
the theory, and all the stratagems employed,
served only to demonstrate her innocence and
utter ignorance of the agency of the so-called
-----File: 243.png---------------------------------------------------------
witchery, and was herself the greatest sufferer
from the affliction.

NEGRO STORIES.
CHAPTER X.

The Experience of Uncle Dean, the Rail Splitter.

Rev. James Byrnes, in his graphic sketch, intimates
that the negroes gave the most thrilling
accounts of the witch operations, but he seems to
regard negro testimony as unreliable and declines
to quote their savings; on general principles no
doubt. But in this the good man is mistaken.
He has not studied the negro character along this
line. The colored brether may prevaricate in
regard to a chicken roost; he may be extravagant
in describing a coon fight; he may dilate humorously
on his possum dog; he may spin fine yarns
about the golden pavements in the New Jerusalem
and the angels sopping possum gravy with ash
cakes and "taters;" he may mislead one in regard
to the contents of his gourd bottle; he may be
weak on the subject of watermellons, and tell fine
stories on Bre'r Rabbit sitting in the fence corner
picking briars out of his feet, but when it comes
to haunts, he is the most reliable witness on
earth. The negro may be off and crooked on

some things, but under no circumstance will he
tell a lie on a ghost, nor deviate a single hair's
breadth from the truth in establishing the existence
of the spooks, The purpose of the writer is
to go to the bottom of this witch history and give
all of the inside faets, and this eannot be dene if
Sambo is ignored. No such a history would be
complete without the stories of Uncle Dean, the
famous rail splitter, and trusty servant of John
Bell, who had many contacts with the witch.
Therefore the writer paid a special visit to Aunt
Thby Gunn, who was a-servant of Alex. Gunn,
and resides at Cedar Hill, Tenn., with her children,
happy and cheerful, and at this writing is
eighty-six years of age, as appears from the Gunn
family record--born October 25, 1806. She was
the vounger sister of Dean's wife, Kate. They
were daughters of Unkle Zeke, a pompous old
darkey who belonged to Rev: Thomas Gunn, and
felt elevated by the pious and dignified chars cter
of his master. Aunt Ibby is the only survivor of
the negro families who lived in that vicinity in
the beginning of the witch history. Being approached
on the subject she replied: "Corse I
members bout dat witch, kase hit cum wid Dean
ter see hiz wife, fur she wuz my sister, an [done
want no mo boderation by dem spirits nudder, [
dont." Aunt Ibby was disposed to stop at this.
She did not care to discuss haunts, lest the demons
mignt return to disturb her. Being assured,
however, that the witches had become very rich
and aristocratic, and had long since gone to Europe
on a pleasure trip, promising not to return

during her life time, she consented to tell some
things that Dean said about it. "De fust time

How Dean Was Turned to a Mute.

Dean had another thrilling and most frightful
experience with the witches, which he told to
Alex. Gunn an others, after relating the same
transaction described in Aunt Ibby's interview.
Said he, "I tole Kate an Uncle Zeke bout how dat
ball tuck fire, shootin off wid dat dog arter I split

How Dean Got His Head Bursted.
There are many persons still living in Robertson
county who remember Uncle Dean. He lived

226 THE BELL WITCH.

to a very old age, and was noted throughout the
surrounding country as the famous rail splitter, a
distinetion which he was very proud of, though
it did net elect him to the presidency of the
United States. However. had he lived in later
years, he might have walked Abraham Lincoln's
log. The negroes and children in the neighborhood
delighted in gathering around the old darkey
to hear his hair raising witch stories. Dean
carried a prominent scar on his forehead, which
gave his physiognomy a very conspicuous cast.
AA good Jady connected with the Bell family, describing
Dean to the writer, says he declared to
the day of his death that this scar was caused by
an unpleasant contact with "Kate." the witeh, in
whieh he was knecked in the head with a big
stick. Dean wasa great possum hunter: Autumn
came in allofits glory. The luscious persinimon
was ripe. and possums fat and plentiful. and
Dean's heart panted for the woods, as did his
appetite long for "possum and taters." | His mind
was bent on a round with the varments. but a
very serious dilemma was presented in the contemplation
of the sport. His experience with
"Black Dog" warned him of the danger in venturing
out without his witch ball, and it was
certain that no game could be found if he carried
it: no dog could trail a possum after eatching the
scent of a witeh ball, So it was. Dean turned the
matter over and over in his mind, and kept a
sharp lookout for "Kate" determined to make
use of the first favorable opportunity that presented.
Finally the time came. Hearing the
-----File: 255.png---------------------------------------------------------
witch in the house carrying on at a great rate
with the visitors, he concluded that was the opportunity
to make a short round, and return
before "Kate" adjourned the meeting. So he
swung his axe over his shoulder, whistled to old
Cwsar and struck out. Next morning Dean was
missing, and Mr. Bell was very uneasy for a time,
but soon after breakfast he showed up with a great
gash in his'cranium and was very bloody. "What's
the matter now Dean?' inquired Mr. Bell. "De
witch dun an had ime fer a fac, ole mars, an fo
God sar, hit lacked ter killed me, hit did. Cepen
fur thinken bout whos gwinter split der rails, I
specs sar _Ideerginup. Kase I knowed dar warnt
gwinter be no mo rails split here cepen I done it,
Dats all dat saved me sar, fur a fact it war."
"How did it happen Dean?" again inquired Mr.
Bell. "Wellole mars, Ize gwinter tu tell der truf
bout it, dat Liz. Fo God sar, it war jest dis way.
I hearn de ole witch in der house sputin wid de
white fokes bout ligiuon. Den I cluded it war a
mighty good time ter go out an kotch er possum
fur dinner Sunday, sposin I cud git back fo de

an turrecly old Cwsar he treed er big possum up
on top uv dat high stump side uv der fence. I

tip, an der next fing I knowed, dar stood a great
big ole rabbit, an Caesar he tuck out he did. Den
I knowed sumpen war gwinter happen, kase dat
dog neber lef me fo dis. Den de ole rabbit sed,
'Hello, Kernel Possum, what's all er dat onimentation
yous got on yer tail?' jest so. Den der
possum sed, "Oh Nerne! Rabbit, Ize so glad yous
cum; dis hante no onimentation, hit am er split
stick Dean put on my tail tu keep me frum gittin
away. Oh bit am hurtin so bad. Please Kernel
take hit off Den Kernel Rabbit, he sed, (Why
hante ver like me, Kerne! Possum; don't hab no
tail, den de niggers cant put split stick on yer,'
Den Kernel Possum sed, 'If 1 done hab no tail
like you, how's I gwinter hold on tu der limbs an
shake simmons down fur you?' 'Dats so,' sez
Kernel Rabbit, jest dat er way, Den Kernel
Rabbit he menced swellin like blewin up-er bladder,

he tuck holt uy dat stick and jerked der split

round to me, Kernel Rabbit did, an sez, 'Dean,

tail in er split stick. Next fing youll be
twisten all uv my hide off tu git me outen de
hollow.' Den he-tuek me kerwheck on der head
wid datstick, an I knowed nufiin mo tel sun up."
This explanation satisfied "old mars," and he told
Dean to go to Aunt Chloe and let her bandage his
head, and lay up until he got well, and hereafter
always wrap the possum's tail around his thumb
and carry it in his hand, and never draw another

Remarkable and Amusing Incidouts Attending the
Great Saldler and Statesmans Visit to the
Witch, ail Other Reminiscences,

Col. Thomas L. Yaneey, a prominent lawyer
of the Clarksville, Tenn., bar, who is closely
related to the Fort family, was raised in the Bell
settlement, and has been familiar with the stories
of the witch as told by different witnesses from
his youth up, contributes the following interesting
sketch from notes taken with a view to writing
the history. In addition to the visit of Gen.
Jackson and party, it will he observed that he
confirms the statements of three other parties in
regard to Dr. Suge's experience:

CriarksviILLs, Trny., Jan. 1, 1894.
MV. Ingraim--~Dear Sir:

In answer to your inquiry as to what I know

about the Bell Witch excitement of many years
-----File: 260.png---------------------------------------------------------
230 THE BELL WITCH.

ago, I will state that I was horn within four miles
of the John Bell home, where the witch is said
to have disported itself to the terror of many good
and pious soula. While quite a young man I
became much interested in the stories my relatives
and other peaple told in regard to the phenomenon,
which | had heard repeated from my
earliest recollection, and ambitious in my youth
to diseover the cause and write a history of the
aifair, TD determined to enter into the investigation,
and did some forty years ago undertake the
matter, gathering many amusing and strange
incidents, but not sufficiently connected and authenticated
to justify my purpose. Tsoon learned
that Williams Bell was the only person who had
kept a diary of what transpired, and had written
the facts, leaving the manuscript with his wife or
some member of his family at his death. OF
course IT was anxious to get the paper, and not
being acquainted with Williams Bell's widow, I
applied to "Squire John Bell, Jr, to know if such
manuscript was in existence, and if it could be
had for publication. He informed me that his
brother had written the facts, etc., regarding the
mystery, and thai Washington Lowe, a lawyer of
Springtield, had apphed for it and been refused.
He thought, however, he eould induce his
brother's family to let him have it, and promised
to intercede for me, Some time after this he told
me that he could not got it, that the family
refused to let him or any one have it, and after
this I gave up the purpose of writing a book and
pursued the investigation no further. However,
-----File: 261.png---------------------------------------------------------
I remember some very graphic stories told by the
old people who visited the scene often, stated as
having absolutely occurred, and told in all seriousness
by persons whose veracity I could not
doubt. My grandfather, Whitmel Fort, told me
that he visited the place often during the excitement,
meeting with many persons from a distance
who came to investigate the witeh. Grandfather
said he could in no way account for the phenomena.
There was no doubt of the fact that something
persecuted Miss Betsy Bell terribly after
she retired to bed. He went with other to her
relicf amid her outerics of agony, and they all
could not hold the bed covering on her, so powerful
was the unseen object in pulling it off.
Even could this haye been accounted for, the
keen ringing sound like that of a hand slapping
her jaws when she would scream with pain, and
the deep red spoches left on her cheeks, were
mysterious beyond comprehension.

Grandfather Fort also told me the story of Gen.
Jackson's visit to the witch, which was guite
amusing to me. The crowds that gathered at
Bell's, many coming a long distance, were so large
that the house would not accommodate the company.
Mr. Bell would not accept any pay for
entertaining, and the imposition on the family,
being a constant thing, was so apparent, that parties
were made up and went prepared for camping
out. So Gen. Jackson's party came from Nashville
with a wagon loaded with a tent, provisions,
etc., bent on a good time and much fun investigating
the witch. The men were riding on horse-*

232 THE BELL WITCH.

back and were following along in the rear of the
wagon as they approached near the place, discussing
the matter and planning how they were going
to do up the witch, if it made au exhibition of
such pranks as they had heard of. Just then,
within a short distance of the house, traveling
over a smooth level piece of road, the wagon halted
and stuck fast. The driver poped his whip,
whooped and shouted to the team, and the horses
pulled with all of their might, but could not move
the wagon an ineh. Jt was dead stuck as if
welded to the earth. Gen. Jackson commanded
all men to dismount and put their shoulders to
the wheels and give the wagon a push. The
order was promptly obeyed. The driver laid on
the lash and the horses and men did their best,
making repeated efforts, but ail in vain; it was
no go. The wheels were then taken off, one at a
time, and examined and found to be all right,
revolving easily on the axles. Another trial was
made to get away. the driver whipping up the
team while the men pushed at the wheels, and
still it was no go. All stood off looking at the
wagon in serious meditation. for they were "stuck."
Gen. Jackson after a few moments thought, realizing
that they were in a fix, threw up his hands
exclaiming, "By the eternal, boys, it is the witch."
Then eame the sound of a sharp metallic voice
from the bushes, saying, "All right General, let
the wagon move on, I will see you again to-night."
The men in bewildered astonishment looked in
every direction to see if they could discover from
whence came the strange voice, but could find no
-----File: 263.png---------------------------------------------------------
explanation to the mystery. Gen. Jackson exclaimed
again, "By the eternal, boys, this is worse
than fighting the British." The horses then
started unexpectedly of their own accord, and the
wagon rolled along as light and smoothly as ever.
Jackson's party was in no good frame of mind for
camping out that night, notwithstanding one of
the party was a professional "witch layer," and
boasted much of his power over evil spirits, and
was taken along purposedly to deal with Kate, as
they called the witch. The whole party went to
the house for quarters and comfort, and Mr. Bell,
recognizing the distinguished character of the
leader of the party, was lavishing in courtesies
and entertainment. But Gen. Jackson was out
with the boys for fan--'"witeh hunting'--and
was one of them forthe time. They were expecting
Kate to put in an appearance according to
promise, and they chose to set in a reom by the
light of a tallow candle waiting for the witch.
The witch layer had a big flint lock army or
horse pistol, loaded with a silver bullet, which he
held steady in hand, keeping a close lookout for
Kate. He was a brawny man, with long hair,
high cheek bones, hawk-bill nese and fiery eyes.
He talked much, entertaining the company with
details of his adventures, and exhibitions of undaunted
courage and success in overcoming
witches. He exhibited the tip of a black cat's
tai), about two inches, telling bow he shot the cat
with a silver bullet while sitting on a bewitched
woman's coffin, and by stroking that cat's tail on
his nose it would flash a light on a witch the

darkest night that ever come; the light, however,
was not visible to any one but a magician. The
party was highly entertained by the vain stories
of this dolt. They flattered his vanity and encouraged
his conceit, laughed at his stories, and
called him sage, Apollo, oracle, wiseacre, ete. Yet
there was an expectancy in the minds of all left
from the wagon experience, which made the
mage's stories go well, and all kept wide awake
till a late hour, when they beeame weary and
drowsy, and rather tired of hearing the warlock
detail his exploits. Old Hickory was the first
one to Jet off tension. He commenced yawning
and twisting in his chair. Leaning over he
whispered to the man nearest him, "Sam, I'll bet
that fellow is an arrant coward. By the eternals,
I do wish the thing would come, I want to see
him run." The Greneral did not have long to
wait. Presently perfect quiet reigned, and then
was heard a noise like dainty footsteps prancing
over the floor, and quickly following, the same
metallic voice heard in the bushes rang out from
one corner of the room, exclaiming, "All right,
General, | am on hand ready for business." And
then addressing the witch layer, "Now, Mr.
Smarty, here: Iam, shoot." The seer stroked his
nose with the cat's tail, leveled his pistol, and
pulled the trigger, but it failed to fire. "Try
again," exclaimed the witch, which he did with
the same result. "Now its my turn; look out,
you old coward, hypocrite, fraud. TH teach you
a lesson." The next thing a sound was heard
like that of boxing with the open hand, whack,
-----File: 265.png---------------------------------------------------------
whack, and the oracle tumbled over like lightning
had struck him, but he quickly recovered his feet
and went capering around the room like a frightened
steer, running over every one in his way,
yelling, "Oh my none, my nose, the devil has got
me. Oh lordy, he's got me by the nose." Suddenly,
as if by its own accord, the door flew open
and the witch layer dashed out, and made a bee
line for the lane at full speed, yelling every jump.
Everybody rushed out under the excitement,
expecting the man would be kuled, but as far as
they could hear up the lane, he was still running
and yelling, ©Oh Lordy." Jackson, they say,
dropped down on the ground and rolled over and
over, laughing. "By the eternal, boys, I never
saw so much fun in all my Hfe. This beats fighting
the British." Presently the witch was on
hand and joined in the laugh. "Lerd Jesus," it
exclaimed, "Ifow the old devil did run and beg;
Vl bet he wont come here again with his old
horse pistol to shoot me. I guess that's fun
enough for to-night, General, and you can go to
bed now. T will come to-morrow night and show
you another rascal in this crowd." Old Hickory
was anxious to stay a week, but his party had
enough of that thing. No one knew who's turn
would come next, and no inducements could
keopthem. They spent the next night in Sprirgfield,
and returned to Nashville the tollowing day.

Tiere was much talk about the witch shaking
hands with one of the Johnson's, a near neighbor,
and Patrick MeGowin, a highly esteemed Irish-man,
who lived across the line in Montgomery

county, and had refused to shake hands with all
other persons, for the reason, as was stated the
witch said, these two men were honest and truthful,
and could be trusted when they promised not
to try to hold or squeeze its hand. I knew Mr.
McGowen well, who was then getting to be quite
an old man, and knew he was cautious, prudent
and perfectly reliable in all he said. This was
his general character, and I went to see him expressly
to hear his own statement about the matter,
We discussed the witch and the many mysterious
stories in regard to the oceurences at
Bell's, which he could in no way account for. I
asked him particularly about the handshaking.
The old gentleman talked about it with some
reluctance. He said the witeh did offer to shake
hands with him, but he was not sure it could be
called a handshaking. He held out his hand for
that purpose, and felt something in his hand.
which felt like a hairy substance. Calvin Johnson
deseribed that which he felt. Hke unto a
womans hand.

Dr. Henry Suge wasa man of great prominence
in that community. He was quite a small boy
during the reign of the witeh, and of course never
witnessed the early demonstration: and growing
up skeptical, did not believe the sterics told: by
the older people. He was disposed to ridicule
the whole matter when spoken of. and he heard
much about it in his practice among the sick.
The old Bell house was torn down after the death
of the old people, and moved to the place neat
Brown's ford. now owned by Levismith, It was
-----File: 267.png---------------------------------------------------------
also said that when the witch took its departure,
it promised to return after a certain number of
years and remain permanently, and this many
people believed. This brings me to Dr. Suge's
statement which I had from his own lips. He
was called: to sce a patient at this house, some
thirty vears after the witch first disappeared, or
in the fifties. If T mistake not. he said Joel Bell
lived there or owned the piace. Anyway, the
subject of the Bell Witch eame up, and the man
told about the strange noise heard and ridiculous
things that had occurred the night before, and
said he was suve that it was the Bell witch. Dr.
Suge laughed at the man and tolklhim it was all
imavination, that the Bell Witch was a hoax and
there never was anything in it, ridiculing his
superstition, Just then he heard a terrible rattling
of the vials in his medical bag. setting on
the floor near the door, where he had placed the
pocket as he entered the house, and immediately
following the rattling noise came the sound of
explosion, as if every bottle in the valise had
bursted or-the corks all poped out. He rushed
immediately to the pockets to see what had happened,
and found eversthing iitaect. Just as it
should be. Then it was the other man's turn to
ridicule him. He, however, tried to explain the
phenomena to the satisfaction of the superstitious
man, and while doing so the same sound was repeated
with still greater force, and the second
examination discovered nothing wrong or out of
place in the valise, and, said he, "I could find no
explanation for the mystery, aad never have; it
-----File: 268.png---------------------------------------------------------
238 THE BELL WITCH.
was so remarkable and unmistakable that there
could be no explanation."

Mrs. Wimberly, who was a daughter of Mat.
Ligon, told me about the visit of Betsy Bell to her
father's on the occasion when the witch followed
and abused her dreadfully, boxing her jaws,
pinehing her arms and pulling her hair, calling
her ugly names, for trying to run away from it.
Ligon's family got no rest that night, and were
terribly frightened. 1 could teil you many other
stories in regard to this unexplained mystery, but
no doubt you have them all from the statement
of Williams Bell and others. T. L. Yancey.

The house referred to by Col. Yancey is the
same building in which Reynolds Powell and
Allen Bell had a lively experience some time about
1861, as described in another chapter. The body
of the house is made of hewed logs, now probably
100 years old, well preserved by weatherboarding.

CHAPTER NII.
Reminiscences From the Girl Who Associated Most
With Betsy Bell.

Mrs. Lucinda E. Rawls, of Clarksville, Tenn.,
widow of the late J. J. Rawls, and daughter by
the marriage of David Alexander Gooch and
-----File: 269.png---------------------------------------------------------
Partheny Thorn, contributes the following graphic
interview from the reminiscences of her mother
and other things connected with the exciting
events of the Bell Witch history, and the effect
and influence upon the community. Theny
Thorn was born in 1803. Her parents lived in
Stewart county, and died while she was quite a
small child, too young to remember them. She
was a niece of Jane Marvlin, who possessed considerable
property, and became the second wife
of James Johnson, father of John and Calvin by
his first marriage. Mr. Johnson and second wife
had no children, and they adopted Theny Thorn
abd raised her from a child, loving her as their
own. bestowing much care and devotion upon
her, and she knew them only as father and mother,
and Mrs. Rawls alluded to the old people most
affectionately as grandfather and grandmother.
Mrs. Rawls very cheerfully granted this interview,
and said she was willing to state anything
she knew personally ov that which she hind heard
repeated by her mother, Grandfather James Johnson,
John and Calvin Johnson, Dr. Ardra Gooch,
John Bell, Jr, and many others coucerning the
Bell Witch. It was, she says, a cominon subject
of discussion in all family circles and neighborhood
gatherings from her childhood up to the
time she left the neighborhood in 1855, and she
has rarely failed to hear the mystery spoken of
on her visits to that vicinity since. Yes," repliel
Mrs. Rawls, in answer to certain questions,
"the Bell Witch was, and is still, a great scapegoat.
Every circumstance out of the regular
-----File: 270.png---------------------------------------------------------
240 THE BELL WITCH.

order of things is attributed to the witch. It has
not been long since a man claiming to be the
witch was waylayed and murdered by two men
who were cleared on the plea that the murdered
man had bewitehed them."

"Mother was very intimate with Betsy Bell,"
coutinued Mrs. Rawls, "and sympathized deeply
with berin the trouble and affliction brought
upon her by the wicked thing. It not only punished
her severely, but frightened the poor girl
almost out of her Hfe, and mother stayed with
her the more on this aceount to relieve her fears;
in fact, her parents were afraid to leave her in her
room alone a single night, and mother stayed
with her almost every night, except when Becky
Porter was there. It was very cruel in some
people, she said, to charge the awful thing against
Betsy. She was only twelve or thirteen vears of
age when the demonstrations commenced. She
was a very tender, sweet girl, and was constantly
under the gentle watch care of her mother, and
never had an opportunity or any chance to learn
such an art, if it were possible, and it was not in
her nature to do so, nor could she haye possibly
escaped detection. Those who accused her could
never state a reason or offer a shadow of evidence
to that effect. The persecutions of the witch were
enough for any frail mortal to bear, (more than
her father could bear) without the slanderous
charges of ignorent men who were incapable of
discerning the cause, to crush her hope in life."
Mrs. Rawls, did you ever hear your mother state
in what particular way the witch annoyed Betsy?
-----File: 271.png---------------------------------------------------------
"Yes, repeatedly; in every conceivable way and
form imaginable. It would not let a bit of cover
stay on the bed. It would pinch the girl till she
would scream, slap her cheeks, pull her hair, stick
pins in her body, and sometimes almost take her
breath. Mother said it would seem to jerk the
tucking comb out of her hair and dash it on the
floor. You know that the girls in those days put
up their hair with long tooth combs, instead of
hair pins as now used. The combs were generally
made of tortoise shell, which were ornamented,
and were pretty and costly, and easily broken by
dropping on the floor, and strange as it appears,
mother said Betsy never had one bruken, though
they struck the floor as if thrown with force.
Mother said she had seen this trick performed
often when looking directly at Betsy, and knew
she did not move her hands, and no visible hand
or cause could be detected. Betsy had a fine suit
of long flaxen hair, which hung in beautiful
waves that made her appear most charming, end
she was very proud of it. When the tuckers were
pulled out, her hair would drop all about her
neck and shoulders and become so tangled that
it would require a full half hour's time to comb
it out. Then the witch would break out with
hilarious Jaughter, 'Ha, ha, Betsy, if Josh could
see you now he would envy me.' It carried on
such mischief nearly all night, pulling the cover
from the bed as fast as they could replace it,
knocking over the chairs and keeping up a continual
gabbing of nonsensical talk and laughter,
and they were compelled to gas with the invisible
-----File: 272.png---------------------------------------------------------
242 THE BELL WITCH.

thing through fear of something werse. Mother
said she had spent many nights with no one else
bat Betsy and herself in the room, with doors
and windows securely closed, and all efforts to
detect the agency of these demonstrations or the
source from whence came the remarkable voice,
were in vain. Another favorite trick of the witch
was that of tampering with Betsy's shoes. Mother
said she had seen the strings tied so tight that the
girl could not loose the knot, and the next minute
the shoes would be unlaced and jerked from her
feet. Sometimes when preparing to retire, the
witch would exclaim, 'Betsy let me unlace your
shoes,' and in a second her shoes would be pulled
from her feet. Mother said she asked the witch
why it would not unlace and remove her shoes,
and the reply would come, 'I don't like you
Theny, you are so silly; I don't want anything
to do with you."

Did you ever hear your mother repeat the circumstance
of the four leaf clover, which has been
so generally spoken of? "Yes, I have heard her
tell it frequently to different persons. That occurred
in this way. There were a number of
young people in company, discussing the witch.
Some one remarked tiat according to the saying,
if any one could find a four leaf clover they would
be able to see the witch. Clover, you know, uniformly
has three leaves, and it is very rare that
four leaves are found. However, mother paid a
visit to the Misses Pacely, daughters of Tanner
Pacely, near Russellville, Ky. The girls were out
one evening for a walk, and while strolling
-----File: 273.png---------------------------------------------------------
through a field, mother discovered a clover with
four leaves, which she pulled, placing it in the
front fold of her dress without calling any attention
to it, intending carrying the clover home to
try her luck, and not one discovered her action
or purpose; nor did she mention the fact to a
soul, lest people would think her superstitious,
and silly. She returned home the next day with
the clover in the bosom of her dress. It was late
in the afternoon when she arrived, and very soon
'Kate,' as they called the witch, exclaimed, 'Lord
Jesus, Theny, what a fool you have made of
yourself; you went all the way to old man Pacely's
to hunt a four leaf clover and brought lt home
secretly in your bosom, believing that it would
enable you to sec me, but you will never be smart
enough for that, ha, ha, ha,' and so it went on
teasing mother, and telling the joke to every one
who came in."

Did the witch stay regularly at James Johnson's?
"No, it only visited grandfather's occasionally,
as it did several other places. Grandfather
was a very devout Christian, and a very
zealous worker in the Methodist Church. He
made it a rule through life to hold family worship
before retiring at night, and often the neighbors
would gather in and have prayer meetings
at his house. The witch was generally present
on such occasions, and during prayers would
thump and scratch on the chairs and do other
mischief, and would tell the folks at Bell's, 'I
went to hear "Old Sugar Mouth" pray last night;
Lord Jesus, how good he did get.' It called
-----File: 274.png---------------------------------------------------------
grandfather 'Old Sugar Mouth.' It also visited
the family at other times, and would talk about
any and everything, discuss the Scriptures, and
gossip about the affairs of the country. Grandfather
said it seemed to know everything that was
transpiring. Uncle John Johnson was at Mr.
Bell's during the last day of the old gentleman's
ilIness. J beard him tell the circumstances of
finding a strange vial of medicine in the cupboard,
which no one could account for or tell
what was in the vial. The witch said it put the
vial there for Old Jack, and had given him a dose
tokillhim, There were several men present, who
had called in to see My. Bell, and hearing this,
some one advised John Bell, Jr., to test the medicine
on acat. He did so, giving the cat a very
small portion, which threw it into convulsions
instantly. The cat squatled, whirled around and
died in a few minutes. Drew Bell had gone out
before the vial was discovered, to direct the hands
about some work on the place, and the first that
Drew heard of the matter was from the witch.
The very moment Drew returned, Kate commenced,
'Drew, John found that vial of medicine
I put in the cupboard for Old Jack, and gave the
cat some of it. Lord Jesus, how it did make that
cat squall, jump up, turn over and die."

Mrs. Rawls, did you ever hear your mother
speak of the exploits of magicians or conjurers
who came along? "Yes, there were ever so many
witch doctors during the time working incantations
and magic arts, but with no avail. They
were a great set of frauds. One or two I have in
-----File: 275.png---------------------------------------------------------
mind, and one who thought he had succeeded to
a wonderful degree. One of these wizards notified
the Bell family that he would be there on a certain
day to kill the witch, and instructed that
two silver dollars be concealed in a certain form
or way, to make bullets, as he would be able to
see the thing and shoot it with a silver bullet.
The Bells tried everything suggested, no matter
what it was, that looked to the discovery of the
plague, and the money was hidden away in the
cupboard as directed, and it was not suspected
that the witch would know anything about it.
The conjurer, however, failed to come, and Kate
then told them all about the arrangement, laughing
heartily, and told them that they had better
take that money out of the cupboard and put it
to some better use. On another oceation a witch
doctor insisted that he,could relieve Betsy of the
spell if she would take his medicine, and she
readily agreed to take his prescription. Mother
remonstrated with Betsy against taking the awful
dose, but she persisted that she would take anything
that anybody would give her, If it was
poison, to get rid of her excruciating pest, and so
she did swallow it down. It very soon made her
deathly sick, as the conjurer promised it would,
and immediately a copious evacuation of the
stomach followed. The excrement was examined
and found to be literally full of pins and needles,
and Kate, the witch, fairiy roared with laughter,
and said that fellow was tne only conjurer who
had ever doneany good:-he had made Bets throw
up pins and needles enough to supply the whole
-----File: 276.png---------------------------------------------------------
246 THE BELL WITCH.

community, and if he would give her anothor
dose of that stuff, he would get enough to set up
a pin and needle store. The witch doctor really
believed that the pins and needles were ejected
from the girl's stomach, and was astounded by the
result of his own practice. There could be no
mistake that they were real brass pins and needles.
Mother gathered up 2 number and kept them as
long as she lived. I have seen the pins and
needles myself. As a matter of course Betsy
could not have lived with such a conglomeration
in her stomach, and the only solution of the matter
was that the witch dropped the pins and
needles in the excrement unobserved; just as it
pulled off her shoes, disheveled her hair, gave her
and her mother hazlenuts, and many other miraculous
performances that no one could ever
account for."

Mrs. Rawls, did you know Mrs. Kate Batts, or
ever hear her name discussed in connection with
the witchery? "Yes, Mrs. Kate Batts lived many
years after the death of John Bell and wife; after
f was quite grown. She was very odd in her
ways, original, having many funny sayings, and
was the common talk of the neighborhood. I
remember that she caused me to get an awful
scolding from father for laughing at her on a certain
occasion. It was during a protracted meeting
at Red River Church. Rey. Thomas Felts had
concluded a revival sermon that aroused the entire
audience, and had called up the mourners, who
were kneeling at the front seat as usual, praying,
when Mrs. Batts came in and spread her riding
-----File: 277.png---------------------------------------------------------
skirt over Joe Edwards, who was a mourner, and
sat down on him. The scene was so ludicrous
that I could not restrain myself, and with several
other girls, we got into a great titter. The efforts
of the brethren to get her up, her refusal to rise,
and quaint expressions, made the matter worse,
and the whole house bursted into laughter. It
was enough to make an angel laugh, and I just
had to tell father that he was too sanctimonious
for heaven. Mis. Batts had but three children.
Mary, her only daughter, was a beautiful girl,
very sprightly and lovely. Ticrsons, both mature
men, were quite to the contrary. John was married;
Calvin tall and very awkward. Mrs. Batts
thought Calvin the finest young man in the
country, and had a peculiar way of introducing
and commending him to society, by pushing herself
into company, remarking, 'Girls, keep your
eyes on Calvin; he isall warp ready forthe filling.'"

"Youask me what people thought of Mrs. Batts
in connection with the witchery. The truth is
some people firmly believed that she was the
witch, and was afraid of her. Seventy-five years
ago people were not very distantly removed from
the age of witchcraft. I:ducational facilities were
limited. People relied on the country school
teacher and the preacher, and as a matter of fact
superstition was abroad in the land. People
accepted the teaching of the Scriptures literally,
and those familiar with the Bible could quote
freely in support cf the doctrine of witchcraft.
The whole country was excited by the wonderful
performances of the Bell Witch, and people un-*
-----File: 278.png---------------------------------------------------------
28 THE BELL WITCH.

able to discover any cause or agency for such
exhibitions, naturally attributed it to witchery,
and there was no better scapegoat than Mrs. Kate
Batts, because it fitted her character so well. The
witch, in the first instance, gave out the information
that it was "Old Kate Batts' Witch." It
was said that John Bell had a misunderstauding
with Mrs. Batts in some trading between them
soon after he came to the country. Mrs. Batts
got very mad, said hard things, and made threats
that sne would get even with him. Again it was
suid that Mrs. Batts was constantly on the pad
from house to house, always wanting to buy wool
rolls or sell something, and begged every woman
she met with fora pin. These with many other
circumstances led superstitious people to believe
that she wasa witch. Those who gave the matter
intelligent consideration and investigation, though
failing on every hypothesis for an explanation of
the mystery. did not believe Mrs. Batts capable
of performing such tricks. But to give you some
idea of the extent and character of the superstition
that prevailed, [will state two or three circumstances.
The fact that Mrs. Batts was always
begging pins was regarded asa direct circumstance
against her, because the witch also had a weakness
for pins, and used them quite freely on Betsy
Bell and the witch doctors, and pins were frequently
found in the bed pillows, stuck from the
inside of the pillow case with points out, and
sometimes found in the chairs, and the saying
was that the witch had power over any one who
gave her pins. Again I remember, on the occa-*
-----File: 279.png---------------------------------------------------------
sion of Mrs. Batts' death, the news soon spread
all over the country, and it was difficult to find
any lady who was willing to set up one night
with the corpse, as was customary. Finally Fannie
Sory volunteered to pay this respect to the
dead if three or four other girls would join her.
and the company was then made up. After the
burial next day, those girls told that they were
beset with black cats and black dogs all night.
One of them vowed to me that it was every word
true, and she could prove it by the other girls.
Two of the girls went to the well during the night
for fresh water, and said they had te fight dogs
with sticks all the way frem the house to the
well--large black curly haired dogs. The yard
was full, while the house was fut! of llack cats,
constantly Jumping on the coffin. This was undoubtedly
a bit of wicked mischiefon the part of
the girls, practicing on the superstition of people,
and many believed every word of it. Doubtless
there were one or two black dogs belonging to the
place, and like as many black cats, as cats and
dogs were generally plentiful about every place.
Another cireumstance which occurred previous
to the old lady's death. Emily Paine had the
task of churning one morning. She was in a
great hurry to get through, and after churning
two hours, and the butter failing to come, her
patience gave out, and she remarked that she just
knew old Kate Batts had bewitched the milk,
and she was going to burn her. She set the
churn of milk aside and heated an iron poker red
hot, and stuck it down in the churn, leaving it

there, saying she was determined to find out if
Mrs. Batts was burnt, and at once made some
excuse for calling on the old lady. Sure enough
Mrs. Batts was nursing a sore hand, which she
said was burnt that morning. This confirmed
the case beyond a doubt. 1 have heard Mrs.
Paine, Ewmily's mother, tell this story and laugh.
Emily Paine afterwards married Henry Calhoon."

The Murder,

The murder referred to by Mrs. Rawls was the
killing of a man named Smith, by Thomas
Clinard and Richard Burgess, which ocurred at a
railroad crossing, between Springfield and Cedar
Hill about 1875 or 76. Smith came into the community
a stranger, and was emploved by Mr.
Fleteher, where Ciinard and Burgess were also engaged
on the farm. Sniith professed to be something
of a wizard, or rather boasted of his power
to hypnotize and lay speils on peop'e, subjecting
any one who came under Ins infltence to his will,
and it was reported that he claimed to have derived
this power from the mantle of the Bell
Witch. However, the writer interviewed Hon.
John F. House, who was council for the derence,
vn the subject, who says that no such evidence
was produced in the trial, but that the lawyers
handled the Bell Witch affair for all that it was
worth in the defence of their clients, presenting
the analogy or similarity of circumstances with
good effect on the jury. The evidence was overwhelming
to the effect that Smith did practice
hypnotism or some such art on the defendants,
-----File: 281.png---------------------------------------------------------
and had them completely under his control and
practiced on their fears with dire threats, and made
them do many foolish things that they detested,
and they could not escape his dogging influence
which subjected them to ridicule. They tried to
evade and shun Smith, and for this he chided
and threatened them; consequently the animosity,
and they planed his murder and wavylaved and
shot him to death, and then surrendered to the
legal authorities, standing trial on a plea of self-defence
and were cleared. It was one of the most
interesting cases that ever came before the courts
of this country, and the entire community acquised
in the decision of the court. No doubt
that the young men owe their escape from the
frearful rigor of the law to the powerful pleadings
and matchless eloquence of Col. House, who has
so often distinguished himself as a great 'orator,
Jawyer and philanthropist. '

CHAPTER NII.

Hon. John D. Tyler Visited the Witch,
Having heard the name of Hon. Jonn D. Tyler
mentioned as one of the investigators, the writer

Tenn., to know if he ever heard his distinguished
father speak of the mystery.

"Yes," said he, "I have heard my father tell
many wonderful things that occurred at Bell's
about the time he moved to this county from
Virginia. I remember that he said reports concerning
the mysterious affair reached Virginia
before he left that State, and his friends laughed
and ridiculed him for moving toa haunted coun-tery.
But of course he paid no attention to such
jeers and jests, for he did not believe the story.
But when he arrived here, which was in the Fall
of 1814, he found great cxcitement prevailing all
over the country, and he joined in with others,
visiting the place to investigate the cause. I shall
not undertake to detail any statements that my
father made in regard to what he saw and heard
on these occasions; but you can refer to me for
the fact that he did state that he investigated the
matter to his full satisfaction: having entered
upon the investigation deeply impressed that the
demonstrations were made by members of the
family, and he pursued his inquiry along this
line, taking every test possible, and became
thoroughly convinced that no member of the
family had anything to do with it, and further
than that. the mystery to him was never solved."

Judge Tyler is so well known in Tennessee,
that the mention ot his name is sufficient for
homepeople. But for the information of there
in other sections, we will state that he is a citizen
of Clarksville, Tenn., County Financier, and
Judge of the County and Criminal Court, which

positions he has held eighteen years by the suffrage
of the people. His father, Hon. John D.
Tyler, was one of the most eminent educators
known in this country in early days. He served
one or two terms in the State Senate, and was
prominent in all public affairs, as he was widely
known as a man of high intelligence, and distinguished
for his thoroughness in everything he
undertook. There is no cuestion that he entered
upon the investigation with the determination to
cizcover the cause if possible, but gave it up after
satisfying himself of his mistake regarding the
connection of any member of the family with the
affair.

Mrs. Mahala Darden's Minute Description of John
Bell--His Strange Affliction--Betsy Belt
and Joshua Gardner Were Lovers.

The writer made a special visit during July,
1892, to Cedar Hill, Tenn., for the purpose of
interviewing Mrs. Mahala Darden, one of the most
estimable ladies of Robertson county, then eighty-five
of age. Mrs. Darden resides with her son,
Charles Darden, a prosperous farmer, two miles
from Cedar Hill. She is the pride and delight of
the family, and a mother to be proud of. Mrs.
Darden retains to a remarkable degree her physical
strength and activity, while her memory is so
clear and bright that she details incidents of her
girlhood with the greatest accuracy, giving dates
and circumstances, and altogether she is one of
-----File: 286.png---------------------------------------------------------
256 THE BELL WITCH.

the most intelligent and entertaining ladies in the
county, loved and venerated as mother by the
entire community. After some pleasant conversation,
the subject of the Bell Witch was broached.

"Yes," replied the good lady, "I have a very
distinct recollection of the prevailing excitement
during the witch period. There never was anything
like it; people talked about nothing else,
and a great many went to hear it; Mr. Bell's house
was full of people almost constantly."

Did you witness any of the witch demonstrations,
Mrs. Darden'? "Oh, no; I was rather too
young. Parents did not think it prudent to take
their children, expecially girls. Moreover, I had
no desire to go at that time."

Will you tell what you know about John Bell
and iis family, and all about the witch, as you
'heard the story fron: the old-people? "Certainly.
John Bell was a fine looking gentleman, a man
of distinguished appcarance, and was one of the
wealthiest men im the country. He always had
plenty of money, and was very prosperous. He
was also popular and highly respected by the
people. T remember distinetly the first time I
ever saw Myr. Bell, and how be impressed me. It
was in I817. My father, James Byrns, was a
magistrate, living then several miles from John
Bells. My. Beil came to my father's one day
with quite a number of men to attend a trial or
some law business before my father. His commanding
appearance was so marked as to distinguish
him over all others, and impress me with
his presence, I was then ten years old, and had
-----File: 287.png---------------------------------------------------------
learned to spin. Work was creditable to a girl
in those days, and especially was it a mark of
distinction for one of my years to become an
expert in handling the cards and spinning wheel,
and I was very proud of it. Well, I had the
wheel out in the middle of the floor, making it
fairly whiz. I had set in for a big day's work,
expecting much praise from mother at night, and
the men soon crowded the house so full that
father told me I would have to move my wheel
out and give up the spinning. I did so, and went
to help mother about other things. Dinner was
prepared for the company, and when I went in
to notify father that dinner was ready, I noticed
that all rose up for the invitation except Mr.
Bell, who shook his head declining. Father extended
him the second invitation, which he still
declined, shaking his head. Some remarks were
made at the table about his refusal. He seemed
depressed, confussed and sullen. Mr. Bell returned
on the following day, riding four or five
miles, telling father that he came expressly to
apologize and explain his conduct on the previous
day, lest he (my father) should take offence for
his refusal to dine. 'Ail ofa sudden, said he,
'my tongue became strangely affected. Something
that felt like a fungus growth came on both
sides, pressing against my jaws, filling my mouth
so that I could not eat or talk. It was said that
Mr. Bell was affected in this way off an on to his
death. Nothing, however, was known at this
time of the Bell witch trouble; at least, was not
known outside of the family. Soon after this my
-----File: 288.png---------------------------------------------------------
258 THE BELL WITCH.

father moved to a farm near Mr. Bell's, and the
two families became intimate. The first I heard
of the witch, was told as a secret, said to have
leaked out through young John Bell, who told
an intimate friend that something strange and
very troublesome was disturbing the family. I
was about twelve years old when the witch excitement
reached it highest tension. Mv father
went frequently to witness the mystery. The
first time he heard it, the noise was like that of
ducks fluttering and washing in a pond of water.
He described many strange things which occurred
after that. Mrs. Lucy Bell told me about the
witch bringing her grapes and hazelnuts, and
emptying the sugar out of the bow] on the hearth,
and many other things. They were wonderful
tricks, but I could not disbelieve Mrs. Bell.
David Darden said he determined in his own
mind one night to outdo the witch. He wrapped
the cover of his bed around his hand, and held
with all his might, but the witch stripped the bed
in spite of him. When it visited Mr. Porter's it
made a noise like a log of wood falling on the
house. The witch told at Mr. Bells that it intended
visiting every family in the neighborhood,
and did visit many as reported, but never came
to my father's that | know of, and I was in constant
dread, fearing it would come. Mrs. Bartlett
said she was there one night when many persons
were waiting to hear the witch talk. Finally a
rapping or noise was heard just outside, and several
went to the door to see what it was, when
the witch laughed out, exclaiming, 'Oh it's noth-*
-----File: 289.png---------------------------------------------------------
ing but old Caesar lapping out of the bath tub."
Old Cesar was the dog. I heard a good deal of
laugh about a trick it played on Drew Bell. Drew
leaned his chair back against the bureau, which
set against the wall, placing his feet on the rounds.
Instantly the bureau was snatched trom behind
him and Drew tumbled down on the floor. The
witch told him to get up, that he ought to have
better sense than lean against the bureau. On
one occasion a little unknown black dog came to
the house, cutting some antics. Mr. Bell said he
would shoot that dog, and started to get his gun.
Mrs. Bell interfered, telling him he must not.
The dog lay down on the floor and rolled over
and over toward the door, and the minute the
dog disappeared from the house the witch exclaimed,
'Look out, Old Jack, here comes Jerusalem.'"

Did you know Rev. Thomas and Rev. James
Gunn, Mrs. Darden? "Indeed I did. They were
the founders of Methodism in this community.
Two nobler ministers never lived in this section,
and I have never seen two men imbued with
more spirituality, and have never heard any
preacher with more inspiration. They preached
all over the country for many miles around, after
going a whole day's journey or more, and great
revivals resulted from their preaching."

Did they visit Mr. Bell's or try to detect the
witch? "My understanding was at the time that
they did. Mr. Bell sent for them often, and they
tried faithfully to throw some light upon the
mystery, but never could."
-----File: 290.png---------------------------------------------------------
260 THE BELL WITCH.

Did you know the Batts family? "Yes; there
were two Batts families. Quite a number ofthe
descendents of Jerry Batts are still living-here,
and they are mighty fine people. The other
Batts family, descendants of Fred and Kate Batts,
have disappeared."

What do you know, Mrs. Darden, of Mrs. Kate
Batts? "Oh, Aunt Kate, as the young people all
called her, was a good kind hearted old lady. She
was very peculiar in her ways, and was-mighty
funny, which made people talk about her a great
deal. But I always liked Aunt Kate, she was so
cheerful and full of life I was glad to meet her.
She was very sensitive. The witch told:some
one that it was 'Old Kate Baits, and this is why
the witch took the name of Kate. Some people
were silly enough to believe it. She heard this
and it made her very mad. She turned loose her
tongue on people who talked about her in a way
that made some really afraid of her. I did not
blame her for getting mad at such foolishness.
Of course she was no witch; if she had been she
would have bewitched every one who talked bad
about her. The witch gave itself many names,
called itself Black Dog, Jerusalem, and other
names. People discussed all of these things,
watched Mrs. Batts, and tried every way. to detect
the cause, but no discovery that I ever heard, of
that threw the least suspicion on Aunt Kate: be-

yond the simple statetnent of the witch, which
as a matter of course was false and intended to
inisledd. You know how people fly to extremes
and jump at conclusions when trying to unravel:
-----File: 291.png---------------------------------------------------------
or penetraie a great mystery. Some charged that
it was John and Drew Bell practicing ventriloquism.
Others thought it was Betsy Bell practicing
some unknown art, but the more sensible
people accepted none of these theories; in fact
they would not support any kind of investigation.
What on earth could possibly have induced
the Bells to inflict so much distress and punishment
on the family, even had they the power?
Not money, for they had that, and refused to
receive a cent from the many strangers and investigators
calling. Not notoriety, for they kept
the whole matter a secret as long as possible.
Then it could not add anything to the good name
Mr. Bell had earned for himself and family and
cherished-so much. No, it was simply a phenomena
which no one could explain."

Did you ever hear Jerry Batts express his
opinion about the witch? "Yes; he discussed it
a great deal with father and mother in my presence,
but they never arrived at any satisfactory
explanation. I remember distinctly one expression
from Mr. Jerry Batts which impressed me.
He remarked to father, 'The witch will never
leave until John Bell's head is cut off, meaning
of course, not as long as the old gentleman lived.
I suppose it was Mr. Bell's peculiar afflictions
that Ied him to make the remark. The witch
had declared its intention to kill him, and the
old gentleman charged his affliction to that source.
The witch did torment him to his grave, and
reviled with ghoulish glee at his burying. A
large crowd of people attended the funeral, and it

was a very solemn occasion--every one seemed
sadly depressed. After the grave was filled and
the crowd of sorrowing friends started to leave,
the witch commenced singing:

'Row me up some brandy, O,
Row row, row row,

Row me up some brandy, O,
Row me up some more.'"

Did you know Joshua Gardner, Mrs. Darden?
"Yes. He was Betsy Bell's lover at the time, and
it was generally believed that the sentiment was
mutual. Betsy thought much of him. Hecame
of a spleridid family of people, was a handsome
young man, full six feet tall, and weighed about
one hundred and sixty pounds. He had dark
hair and gray eyes, was intelligent and entertaining,
and a man of good deportment, and very
popular in the community."

Please, Mrs. Darden, describe Betsy Bell?
"Betsy was a beautiful girl. She was light complected;
what you would call a blonde. She was
a little above inedium height, presenting a graceful
figure and elegant carriage. She possessed a
rare suit of rich golden hair, soft gentle blue eyes
and winning ways, and with all was an industrious,
bright and interesting girl, who had more
admirers than any girl in the country. I thought
a great deal of Betsy; she was a sweet good girl,
and I deeply sympathized with her in her disap-pointments
and afflictions."

Then Betsy did not marry young Joshua Gardner?
"No; she finally married Richard Powell,
-----File: 294.png---------------------------------------------------------
264 THE BELL WITCH.
her school teacher, who was a very prominent
man."

Do you know, Mrs. Darden, what broke up the
love affair between Betsy and Gardner, and indueed
her to marry Powell? "Ah, now you ask
me a hard question; T cannot tell. You may
learn that from others. It was said that the
witeh had something to do with it, but [do not
know. I always thought Betsy loved Gardner
best, that is she seemed happy in his company,
and he was certainly greatly devoted to her when
out in society. You know, however, that it has
always been said that destiny controls the fortunes
of men and women. You know also that women
are counted as very tickle creatures, and there is
no accounting for the change of a woman's mind
in love affairs, and often the most desperate love
eases come to naught. Don't you think I have
told you enough?

"Yes, Mrs. Darden, many thanks for this very
entertaining interview."

Rev. James G. Byrns, one of the oldest and
most highly esteemed citizens of Springfield,

and whose integrity is above reproach of any
kind, eoutributes the following interesting sketch,
which goes to establish the character of the wit-*
-----File: 295.png---------------------------------------------------------
nesses, giving a graphic account of the first appearance
of the witcn and its operations. The
writer of this sketch is a son of Squire James
Byrns, who was the good magistrate of the Bell
district, a man of high moral character, noted for
his intelligence and general usefulness as a citizen,
and his impartiality and faithfulness in the discharge
of his official duties. Mr. Byrns being
requested to prepare a sketch, writes as follows:

Of course I am too young to know anything
personally about the bell Witch, but shall endeavor
to state faithfully some of the facts impressed
upon me, as I have so often heard them
detailed by my father, Janes Byrns, Sr, John
Johnson, Calvin Johnson, Alex. Gunn, Sr, Wil
liam Porter, Frank R. Miles, Martin Pitman,
Mrs. Rebecca. Long, my wifc's mother, who was
Rebecea Porter, Mrs. Martha Bell. and many
other citizens, and have also heard wiany miraculous
statements by negrocs, which b will not
repeat.

Old Mr. Bell told my father, also Jolin Johnson
and others, that the first unaccountabie object
that attracted i¢s attention was a large strange
looking animal, resembling a doug. He walked
out to the field to see if the fodder was ripe enough
to gather. Before starting he cleaned his gun
and loaded it to shoot squirrels and rabbits around
the field. About the middle of the field, he said.
he discovered the animal sitting in the row, looking
intently at him. He approached nearer to
it, and the dog, as he thought it was, did not
move, Which surprised him, and he then con-*
-----File: 296.png---------------------------------------------------------
266 THE BELL WITCH.
cluded to shoot it. At the fire of the gun the
strange looking creature ran, and as svon as it
moved, he discovered that it was an uncommon
animal, and knew there was no dog in the country
like it. However, this circumstance was
without significance, and was forgotten untll later
developments connected it with other affairs.
Soon after this the trouble commenced. Something
appeared scratching on the outside well of
the house, and occasionally a tap at the door.
Mr. Bell said he frequently went out to see what
was the matter, but could discover nothing. He
said nothing about it, not even to the family, lest
it might alarm them, and thinking too that it
was some one playing pranks, and by watching
he would be able to discover the intruder. Such
demonstrations continued to increase, being heard
two or three times during a week, and become so
intolerable that Mr. Bell determined to lay some
scheme to catch the offender. Finally the mysterious
knocking appeared to be within the upper
story of the house, and sometimes the noise would
appear like trace chains or harness falling on the
flour above him, but on investigation nothing
could be found. From this on the demonstrations
increased, and appeared like rats gnawing
and dogs fighting in the house. After carrying
on at this rate for some time, it commenced troubling
various members of the family, pulling the
covers off of the beds, pinching and slapping the
children, and became so frightful that the family
could no longer conceal their distress, and neighbors
were called in to witness the strange occur-*
-----File: 297.png---------------------------------------------------------
rences and detect the cause. But no one to this
day has been able to explain or account for the
mystery. The more people investigated, the more
demonstrative it became, sounds like heavy stones
and chunks of wood falling on the floor being
heard. Finally the witch commenced talking
and laughing, singing and praying. For some
time it was very pious, and later became extremely
wicked, using unchaste and most offensive
language. The mystery deepened, and every
one who undertook to explain it were covered
with confusion. Some people thought it was two
members of the Bell family practicing ventriloquism,
but this theory soon exploded, by applying
the strictest tests. The reader will remember
that I am stating these things just as they were
detailed to me by the parties above named, who
were witnesses all through the troubles. The
witch talked more freely to some parties than to
others. It seemed to prefer talking with John
Johnson and Bennett Porter more than any other
persons, perhaps because they were more disposed
to humor and gas with it than were others. Bennett
Porter was Mr. Bell's son-in-law--married
Esther Bell. The witch promised him one night
to go home with him that the family might have
some rest. Then it said, "Bennett, you will try
to kill me if I visit your house." "No I wont,"
'replied Porter. "Oh, but I know you," replied
the witch, "but I have been to your house. Do
you remember that bird you thought sung so
sweet the other morning?" "Yes," replied Porter.
"Well that was me." Then continued the witch,
-----File: 298.png---------------------------------------------------------
268 THE BELL WITCH.

"Bennett, didn't you see the biggest and poorest
old rabbit that you ever saw in your life, as you
came on here this evening?" "Yes," replied: Mr,
Porter. 'Well that was me," said the witch, and
then bursted into laughter. This was the kind
of gossip it carried on constantly, and would tell
what different people in the neighborhood had
been doing during the day, or what was then
transpiring.

It seemed to take speciai delight in afflicting
and tormenting ofd Mr. Bell, and his young
daughter Betsy. It often said that it had cone
to kill old Jack Pall, and it was said that Mr.
Bell died from strange aficiions visited on him
by his tormentor. fcinterfersd a great deal with
Betsy's love affairs. and) wanted her to marry'a
certain man in the neighborhood. Betsy complained
of a painful sensation like some one
sticking pins in her body. Tt would fill her hair
full of pins, jerk her thexing comb out. and laugh
at its own wieked tricks and Hetsv's discom fiture,
and she was frequently sent fron home for rest
and freedom front the tortures inflieted by the
witeh,

Tt wax very conmion fer Jarge crowds to gather
at Mr. Bell's to hear the witch talk. One night
when the house was full, there came an old gentleman
by the name of Grizzard. The witeb
entered with the exclamation, "Here is old Grizgard;
you all just ought to hear old Grizzard call
his hogs. He begins, 'Pig, pig, pig." The hogs
come in a run, and Griz counts them and. then
begins hollering, 'Here, here, sic, sic, sowey, sowey.'
-----File: 299.png---------------------------------------------------------
That's the way old Grizzard feeds his hogs." And
Mr. Grizzard said the witch was correct. Next
came the exclamation or inquiry, "Where is
Jerusalem?" (Jerusalem was a member of the
witch family.) No one replying, the same voice
answered, "There he is on the wall." All eyes
were at once turned to discover a large black bug
crawling on the wall. Mr. Bell remarked, "Well,
if that is Jerusalem, I will kill him," and he did
kill the bug. The witch laughed heartily, exclaiming,
"Lord Jesus, what a fool I did make of
old Jack Bell."

The witch seemed to like old Mrs. Lucy Bell.
It called her "Old Luce," and said Old Luce was
a good woman, which was indeed her character
throughout the country. Mrs. Bell had quite a
spell of sickness, and one morning refused her
breakfast. Very soon Mrs. Bell heard a soft
pathetic voice, apparently just above her head,
calling her name, "Luce, poor Luce, are you sick
Luce?" "Yes," replied Mrs. Bell,"Tam." "Well
Luce, hold out your hands, and I will give you
some hazelnuts I brought from the bottom; they
will be good for you." Mrs. Bell held out her
hands and received the hazelnuts as they dropped.
Presently the same voice inquired, "Luce, poor
Luce, why don't you eat the hazelnuts?" "Oh,
you know that I can't crack them," replied Mrs.
Bell. Then it told her to hold out her hands
again, saying, "I will crack some for you." Instantly
the sound of the cracking was heard, and
the cracked nuts were dropped on her lap. Several
ladies were there ministering to Mrs. Bell,
-----File: 300.png---------------------------------------------------------
270 THE BELL WITCH.

and testified to this. That night the witch came
in with the news that a baby had just been born
to a family living in the bottom, which proved
to be correct as stated. I understand that the
baby was Mrs. Wash. Ayers, now living. The
next day it visited Mrs. Bell again, bringing a
bunch of wild grapes in the same manner as the
hazelnuts came.

On another occasion the witch came in a jolly
good mood, when quite a number of persons were
sitting in the room engaged in social intercourse,
announcing its presence with the inquiry, "Who
wants some grapes, and that moment a bunch of
large wild grapes dropped in Betsy Bell's lap. I
heard John Bell, Jr., and others confirm this
circumstance.

Calvin Johnson told me that after some persuasion
the witch consented to shake hands with
him if he would promise not to catch it. He
promised and held out his hand, and instantly
felt something like a soft delicate hand resting
on his. The hand was placed Iengthwise on his,
so that he could not grasp it. John Johnson
asked the witeh why it would not shake hands
with him? The answer was, "You are a rascal,
Jack; you want to catch me." John said that
was just what he intended to do. The witch
seemed to have more confidence in Calvin Johnson
than any one. It said Calvin was an honest
man, truthful and free from deceit, and this was
true of the man.

John Johnson called in one night when the
witch was in a great way talking, and addressing
-----File: 301.png---------------------------------------------------------
the witch said, "Well Kate, you can't tell what
my wife has been doing to-day?" "Yes I can, it
promptly replied, "she has been baking cakes for
you to carry along tu eat on your trip to Nashville,
where you intend starting to-morrow." This
Mr. Johnson said was true, and no one outside
of the family could have known it.

One night some one inquired of the witch what
was going on over at Jesse Bell's? "I don't
know," it answered, "but will go and see." Five
minutes Jater the witch returned and told what
every member of the family was doing at that
hour, which was confirmed the next day by Jesse
Bell.

During the excitement the conjurers and experts
in divining mysteries came along, and of
course the Bell family were disposed to let them
try their experiments. One of these was a smart
fellow from the East, who claimed tobe a witch
killer, and said he could, by some sort of divination,
see witches and shoot them. This smart
gentleman conjured around several days with hair
balls and foxfire, washed out his gun with his
charm mixture, molded silver bullets and loaded
for the witch, and set around day after day waiting
for the goblin to put in its appearance, but
Kate did not show up. He said the witch was
afraid of him and would not come as long as he
remained. The family had almost arrived. at the
conclusion that there was something in the man,
and Mr. Bell was seriously contemplating the
wisdom of hiring the gentleman from the East to
stay about to keep the witch away. The family
-----File: 302.png---------------------------------------------------------
272 THE BELL WITCH.

had not enjoyed so long a respite since the spectre's
firstappeared. Finally the witch killer concluded
that he would go home, and return very soon to
stay longer, should Kate make any more trouble.
But he was firmly impressed that nothing more
would be heard of it. His horse was brought to
the front near the house, the witch man placed
his saddle bags, stuffed with all kinds of conjurations,
on the saddle, and bidding good-bye to
Mr. Bell, the family and friends who came out to
see him off, he mounted his horse to start, but
the animal would not budge. He kicked, spured
and whipped, but it was no go. The horse would
rare up, fall down and roll and kick. 'The witch
man then turned to conjuring his horse, rubbed
and petted the animal until it became quiet, and
then mounted again, but the horse still refused
togo. The witch killer was about to give up in
despair, when the familiar voice of Kate was heard
in the air, exclaiming, "I can make that horse
go. Let me geton behind." Just then the horse
dashed off, seemingly of its own accord, making
a circle around the yard, kicking and squealing
with wild rage, and the witch hollering, "Hold
on old man, hold on." Finally the horse struck
a bee line for the gate, and out he went, kicking
and snorting, the rider hanging to the mane of
the horse's neck, yelling for dear life, "Oh mercy."
It appeared, however, that it was "Kate" and not
mercy that had him. The witch laughed a week
over that transaction. "Lord Jesus," it said, "I
seared that. old man nearly to death. I stuck
him full of brass pins. He will spit brass pins
-----File: 303.png---------------------------------------------------------
and foxfire for the next six months. Lord Jesus,
how he did beg. I told the old scoundrel that
he came here to kill me, and I was not going to
let him off easy. He said if I would let him
alone he never would come here again. I broke
him from trying that caper any more."

The witch told various stories concerning itself,
and said it could be anything, assume any form
it desired; a dog, a rabbit, bird, or human form.
It finally told the family that if Betsy would
marry a certain gentleman, it would leave and
not trouble them any more. The negroes could
tell the most wonderful stories, and narrate miraculous
escapes.

The men and women whom I have mentioned
my authority for this statement are all dead, but
their memories live and speak for their integrity
and veracity. They were as pure and truthful
people as T ever knew, and strange and mysterious
as the story of the Bell Witch may seem, I
could not, if I would, doubt the statements of
these people. As to what it was, or who it was,
I can not form or express any opinion, but as to
the truth of the trouble, [have not the shadow
of a doubt. The evidence that James Byrns, Sr.,
was my father, is not to me a particle stronger or
more convincing. There is no court in all of the
land that would require one-half of the testimony
to establish any fact, as can be produced in support
of the story of these wonderful demonstrations,
rather I should say history, for in fact it is
a part of the early history of Robertson county,
and will be handed down from generation to
-----File: 304.png---------------------------------------------------------

generatiou in this county, just as stirring events
that transpired at the building of Solomon's
Temple have come down through a certain channel
to the present time. Like the queen of Sheba
when she heard the fame of Solomon concerning
the name of the Lord, she came to prove him
with hard questions, and confessed that the half
had not been told her, people came from all quarters
to see with their own eyes, or rather, hear
with their own ears, and prove what they believed
a cheap fraud and deception, but returned worse
confounded than ever. Though Mr. Bell was a
man in good prosperous circumstances, strangers
and visitors who came on the mission of divining
the mystery almost eat him out of house and
home. In conclusion, therefore, I must confess
with the testimony before me, T believe as firmly
as I can believe anything that. I have not seen or
felt, the truth of the existence of the Bell Witch.
James G. Byrns.
Some Thrilling Incidents Told by Mrs. Nancy Ayers,
the Baby the Witch Spanked.
Washington Ayers and wife are two happy old
people living some two miles from the old Bell
place, and about the same distance from Cedar
Hill, Tenn. Mrs. Nancy Ayres is a daughter of
John and Patsy Johnson, who had a most thrilling
experience in trying to detect the authorship
of the demoniac exhibitions which disturbed the
Bell family. She was born in 1819, and is still a
very active lady for one at her ripe age. She is

276 THE BELL WITCH.

also intelligent and very entertaining, especially
in describing the sensation which the Bell Witch
left behind to live after the intensely exciting
events of that period. Mrs. Ayres is greatly
esteemed in the community. She inherited that
rugged honesty which characterized the Johnson
family, and is affectionately called "Aunt Nancy"
by every one. The writer was told before visiting
Mrs. Ayers, "You can rely on everything Aunt
Nancy says as strictly correct."

Mrs. Ayers was asked if she was willing to tell
all she knew about the Bell Witch? "Oh no, I
could not tell the half I have heard in a week;
strictly speaking, I know nothing. I was bora
in the middle of the most exciting events, and
and they say that the witch was the first to carry
the news of my birth to the Bell family. All I
know is hearsay from father, mother, Grandfather
James Johnson, Uncle Calvin Johnson, Joel Bell,
and everybody who lived in the neighborhood at
that time, and, of course, I believe their statements
as firmly as if 1 had witnessed the demonstrations."

It is said that the witch whipped you when a
baby. How is that, Mrs. Ayers? 'Well, that is
what father and mother told me repeatedly after
I had grown up. It occurred in this way: Betsy
Bell frequently came to our house to spend the
night and get some rest if possible from the. witch.
In fact, father invited and urged her to' come.
He said he had two purposes in view; one was a
desire to render any services possible that would
relieve the family of the pest even for a short
time. His second reason was a determination to
-----File: 307.png---------------------------------------------------------
follow up every clue, or every line of investigation,
that had been suggested or could be thought
of, in an effort to elucidate the mystery. This
he was doing on his own account and in his own
way, and proceeded in a way to elude all suspicion
of his purpose. Several persons who had
been trying the detect to cause of the remarkable
exhibitions and failing, had arrived
at the conclusion that Betsy Bell possessed some
extraordinary gift akin to ventriloquism, and was
practicing a deception in collusion with some
other person, and that he had about arrived at
this conclusion himself, but carefully concealed
his convictions from her and all other persons,
and he thought he would have a better opportunity
of determining this matter if she were to come
alone to spend a few nights at his house. As
before stated, she did come, and the witch came
with her, keeping up so much talking, scratching,
knocking over the chairs, pulling the covering
from the beds, and other vexatious disturbances
that it was impossible for any one to sleep while
it was there, and this all went to confirm his
opinion. So it happened one night when Betsy
and the witch was there, that I was fretful and
worried mother a great deal, she having to get up
frequently to rock my cradle. Finally Kate, as
they called the witch, spoke factiously, inquiring
of mother, 'Patsy, why don't you slap that child
and make it behave itself? If you won't I will.'
Instantly they heard something like a hand
spanking me, and I yelled to the top of my voice,
as if something was taking my life, when both
-----File: 308.png---------------------------------------------------------
278 THE BELL WITCH.

father and mother sprang out of bed to my rescue.
They searched the room all over, but could
find nothing irregular, no persons but themselves
in the room, and no possible way that anyone
could have gotten in and out without a noise or
detection."

Did you behave after that? "Well, they said
I did behave like a little lady the balance of the
night."

Did your father's investigations satisfy him
thoroughly that Betsy Bell was culpable in the
witch demonstration? 'Ohno. To the contrary
be became thorougily satisfied that Betsy was
entirely innocent of the whole matter, and was a
great sufferer from the infliction, as was her father.
It was said by those who had been watching
Betsy, that the witch never talked when hez lips
were closed. This was not true. He said it
talked to him not only when her lips were closed,
but when she was not near, not in talking or
hearing distance, and in fact would talk at old
man Bell's when neither Betsy, Drew or young
John were on the place, and yet scemed to follow
Betsy wherever she went, going with her to
grandfather's, James Johnson, when she visited
Theny Thorn, and at bedtime go through the
form of reading a chapter in the Bible, singing
grandfather's favorite song, and offer prayer, Just
as he would. Father said it did many things
that would have been impossible for a young girl
like Betsy, and told things that she could not
possibly have known. The witch talked almost
incessantly, gabbing and spouting about every-*
-----File: 309.png---------------------------------------------------------
thing that was going on in the country, seemed
familiar with everybody's business, telling things
that no one present knew anything about, called
strangers by name and telling where they were
from before they could introduce themselves. It
would also quote Scripture, discuss doctrinal
questions, sing songs, and pray eloquent prayers,
and never failed to answer any question concerning
any passage, verse or text in the Bible correctly,
giving full references as to where it might
be found. Then on the other hand it could be
very wicked and out curse a sailor. Mr. Bell
sometimes sent for father to set up and entertain
Kate, that the family might get a little rest. He
rather liked this, as it afforded him a better opportunity
for prosecuting his investigations. The
witch also seemed to like gossipping with him,
and there was a peculiar excitement about it that
interested him, and he would sit and talk to the
thing just as patiently and earnestly as if he was
discussing a very important matter with some
person. Father said that one night after the
witch had gone on for some time prattling about
everything in the country, he concluded to change
the topic and lead it out concerning itself, and
beginning with flattery he said, 'Kate, I love to
talk with you because you are so smart and can
always learn me something. You and I have
been good friends, and I want to know more
about you. Now there is no person present but
you and I; tell me confidentially something about
yourself?' 'No Jack,' was the reply, 'I can't tell
you that yet, but I will tell you before I leave.'
-----File: 310.png---------------------------------------------------------
280 THE BELL WITCH..

'How long before you will leave?' 'I won't tell
you that neither, but I wili not feave as long as
old Jack Bell lives ... Have you really come to
kill old Jack?-Yes, T have told him so over
and often" 'What has old Jack done that you
want to kill him? 'Oh, nothing particular; I
just don't like him. 'But everybody in' the
country likes him and regard him as a very fine
old gentleman, don't they?) 'Yes, and that is
the reason he needs killing. 'But Kate, if you
kill old Jack without giving a better reason than
that, people will think very hard of you, and
then according to law you will be hung for murder,
won't you?' 'No, its catching before hanging"
'Yes, but aint the maxim, "murder will
out," equally true?" 'That may be Jack, but still
its catching before hanging.' 'Well Kate, tell me
why you hate Betsy: aint she a sweet lovely girl?'
'How do you know Jack, that I hate Betsy"
'Because you are always following and ding-donging
after her. 'Well, is that any evidence
that I hate her? 'But then you pull her hair,
pineh her arms, stick pins in her" 'Well, don't
lovers play with each other that way sometimes?'
'No, I never did; no man who really loves a girl
will serve her as you do Betsy. 'How do you
know that lamaman? 'Because you get drunk
and curse sometimes, and say and do things that
no nice woman woulddo. 'But Jack, why should
I be a woman; may I not bea spirit or something
else?" 'No Kate, you are no spirit. A_ spirit
can't pull the cover from beds, slap people, pull
hair, stick pins, scratch, and do such things like
-----File: 311.png---------------------------------------------------------
you. 'Well, I will make you think Iam a spirit
before you get home.' 'How are you going to do
that, Kate? 'I am going to scare you.' 'You
can't scare me, Kate; J know that you are too good
a friend to do me any harm, and therefore I am
not afraid of you.' 'Well, just wait until you
start through the woods home, and see if I don't
make you hump yourself" 'Oh phsaw, Kate, you
are just joking and gabbing now. Tell me where
you live, and who and what you are, anyhow"
'T live in the woods, in the air, in the water, in
houses: with people; I live in heaven and in hell;
Iam all things and anything I want to be; now
don't you know what Iam?' 'No, I don't; come
and shake hands with me like you did with Calvin.'
'No, I can't trust you, Jack.' 'Why Kate,
you trusted my brother Calvin. and [am just as
good as he is?) 'No you are not,' returned Kate,
'Calvin is a good Christian and a true man; he
won't violate his promise foranvthing. 'Neither
will I" 'Ob, but you are Iving, Jack; [know you
too well. You are smarter than Calvin, but you
area grand rascal. old Jack Johnson. You just
want a chance to catch me; that is what you are
here for, trying to find out who or what Iam,
and you want a chance to grasp my hand.' After
much gasing on this line, the conversation ended
some time time after midnight and fatherstarted
home. Kate never would shake hands with him,
though he importuned often, nor did he ever
learn anything more about the witch than was
manifested in this conversation. which I have
heard him repeat so often that I remember it
-----File: 312.png---------------------------------------------------------
282 THE BELL WITCH.

word by word. Father said as soon as he reached
the woods, the bushes and trees commenced
cracking, like they were all breaking down, and
sticks and chunks of wood fell about him thick
and fast, as if thrown by some one. He never
would acknowledge that he run, but I always
believed he did. Father said the witch seemed
to know his mind and purpose as well as he did
himself, and that he was fully determined to try
to catch it by the hand if it had shaken hands
with him."

Did you ever hear Calvin Johnson say it shook
hands with him? "Yes, I have heard Uncle Calvin
make the statement frequently. He said the
witch made him promise not to grasp or squeeze
its hand before it consented, and he could not
violate his promise. He said he held out his
hand, and very quick felt the pressure of another
hand on his, whieh was laid lengthwise, and not
across, in the common form of shaking hands,
and that it felt very soft, like a woman's hand.
But it never would trust father, though it showed
a preference for talking with him. It told others
as it told him, that old Jack Joohson was smart
and cunning, that he was a grand raseal, always
hatching plans and schemes to catch it, and he
had to be watched."

Mrs. Ayres, your father, you say, addressed the
witch as "Kate," did you ever hear him explain
how it came by that name? "Yes; people continued
their expostulations with overtures and
importunities to reveal its name, purpose, ete.
The witch bad given many names and various
-----File: 313.png---------------------------------------------------------
explanations of its presence, but the biggest sensation
of all came when it told that it was old
Kate Batts' witch. Mrs. Batts was a very sensitive,
peculiar, blustering kind of woman, whose
eccentricities subjected her to much ridicule, and
her original oddity was a kind of jesting stock,
and common talk. So it was a popular hit, and
started fresh gossip for all laughing tongues. It
made the old lady very mad; she cut tall capers
and said more funny things in her maledictions
and imprecations than was ever heard, and naturally
everybody took to calling the witch "Kate."

Did anybody really believe that Mrs. Kate Batts
was the witch? "Yes, some people did, and they
were afraid of her. Father said the idea was the
most absurd and preposterous that bad been advanced;
contrarv to all reason. Mrs. Batts, he
said, could not have had any eonception of such
a thing, much less praetice the art, eluding detection.
On anether occasion father said he was
postulating with Kate, begging the witch to tell
something about itself. Kate replied, 'Well Jack,
if you will agree to keep it a secret, and not tell
old "Sugar Mouth," (that was grandfather) I will
tell you.' Of course father agreed to that. 'Now,'
says Kate, 'I am your step-mother" Father
replied, 'Kate, you know you are lying; my step-mother
is a good woman, and the best friend I
have. She would not do so many mean things
as you are guilty of' 'Now,' replied Kate, 'I can
prove it to you" Grandmother Johnson had an
unruly servant who would go wrong, irritating
her very much, and the old lady was constantly
-----File: 314.png---------------------------------------------------------
284 THE BELL WITCH.

after Rachel, raising a sharp storm about her ears.
Father said the witch at once assumed the wice
and tone of his step-mother, and got after Rachel.
'Tut, tut, Rachel, what makes you do so," imitating
grandmother exactly."

Did your father ever speak of meeting the witch
doctors and conjurers at Bell's? "Oh yes, ever so
many came, and father used to tell many ridiculous
and laughable incidents regarding the experiments
of witch killers. The Beli's allowed
every one who came along to experiment to his
full satisfaction, and the witch always got the
best of them. I remember one incident that
amused him very much. This fellow put some
silver, twelve dollars, In a bowl of water, performed
his incantations, and set the bowl away,
that the silver might remain in the water all
night to work the enchantment when the witch
come. Betsy Bell had to drink the enchanted
water. Next morning the money was gone, which
caused a mighty stir. A negro was charged with
stealing the money, and Mr. Bell was threatening
the servant with a whipping. This was one of
the times that Kate came to the negro's rescue.
'Hold on, old Jack,' spoke Kate, 'that negro is
innocent; I can tell you who got that money,'
and did tell. Mr. Bell dropped the matter and
said no more about it. Several evenings later
father went over to entertain the witch while the
family and visitors slept. After all had retired
and everything was quiet, father said he sat leaning
his chair against the wall, waiting for Kate.
Presently he felt something touch him on the
-----File: 315.png---------------------------------------------------------
shoulder, and he was directly accosted by the
voice of the witch. 'Say Jack, did you hear about
that money scrape they had here the other evening?'
'Yes, replied father, 'I heard something
about it' 'Well, it was funny; I saved that nigger
from a good whipping by telling old Jack
who got the money, and then went on to state
that the person who got the money went to Springfield
yesterday and bought lots of nice things
with it. 'Ha, ha, ha, I guess they will quit fooling
with these witch doctors now.' Father had
oceasion to go to Springfield a day or two later,
and inquired about the transactions of this pergon,
as told by Kate, and found that the witch
had reported correctly."

Did you, Mrs. Ayers, ever hear Bennett Porter
say anything about the witch? "No; Bennett
Porter moved away while I was quite a child. I
have, however, heard various persons say that
Bennett Porter shot at the witch, and it made
much ado about it, threatening something scrious
to him or his children. I have also heard it repeated
by many that the witch was seen by Betsy
swinging on the limb of a tree and looking likea
litéie girl dressed in green."

Did you ever hear Williams or Joel Bell express
any opinion in regard to the witch? "Nothing
particular. They discussed it in a general way
when asked questions regarding the demonstrations,
but never seemed. disposed to talk much
about it. I suppose they had heard enough of it.
However, Joel told me that the witch gave him
the severest whipping he ever felt, and one that
-----File: 316.png---------------------------------------------------------
286 THE BELL WITCH.
he would never forget as long as he lived."

Mrs. Ayers, did you ever hear anything detrimental
in any way to the character of Joun Bell
or his family? "Not a breath in the world. No
man or family stood higher in the estimation of
the people than John Bell. I have heard him
spoken of as one of the leading men of the country,
and father said the citizens had the utmost
confidence in his integrity. More than that, he
raised his children to be honorable men and
women, and the family influence is felt in Robertson
county to this day; even the grandchildren
are men of the same substantial character."

Do you remember anything about Rey. Thomas
and Rev. James Gunn? "Yes, certainly; they
were the founders of Methodism in this section,
and Rev. Sugg Fort was the leading Baptist.
Their lives were full of good works and honors.
I have heard it said many times that they visited
Mr. Bell often and sympathized with him in his
distress."

TESTIMONIALS.
CHAPTER XIV.

The Bell Family, the Gunns, Forts, Johnsons, Porters,
Frank Miles and Other Citizens Whose Statements
Authenticate the History of the Bell Witch,

Rev. Joshua W. Featherston, of Cedar Hill,
Tenn., who after a long and useful career retired
-----File: 317.png---------------------------------------------------------
from the ministry and now lives happily, himself
and wife, at his cottage, honored by all people,
writes as follows:

Crepar Hine, Treny., Dec. 28, 1804.

Jn answer to the request to contribute what I
know in regard to the characters or standing of
Rev. Thomas Gunn, Rev. James Gunn, Rev. Sugg
Fort, John and Calvin Johnson, W. B. Porter,
Frank R. Miles, and the Bell family, 1 will state
that they were among the early settlers of Robertsoncounty,
Tenn. Iwasintimately acquainted
with each and every one of them except old Mr.
John Bell, who died just before I settled in the
neighborhood, and it is with pleasure that I can
testify to their high characters as men of worth
and standing in the community. They were
men of undoubted honor, possessing strong minds,
and were not easily imposed upon.

As to the subject in hand, the Bell Witch, the
history of which is made up from the detail statements
of these men, in connection with others, I
can say that I have had many conversations with
the parties in regard to the matter, and they all
testified to very nearly the same facts and details,
and I believe every word they told me respecting
the demonstrations. As regards Rev. James and
Rev. Thomas Gunn, they did more towards the
establishment of the Methodist church in this
country than any other men. In fact they were
the founders of Methodism in this and surrounding
counties, and their influence is felt to this
day. They married at least two-thirds of the
couples, and preached nearly all the funerals, in

this and surrounding country during many years,

ripe with age and full of honors.

J. W. FEaTHERSTON.
About Frank R. Miles' Experience.

The writer had an interesting interview with
Rev. J. W. Featherston at his pleasant home,
since the above letter was written. He repeats
many thrilling incidents told him by the men
above mentioned, all of which is found in other
testimony. Mr. Featherston says he had more
talk with Frank Miles in regard to the actions of
the witch than any one else, and had implicit
confidence in Miles as a man who would not exaggerate
or mistate the truth. Miles weighed
about two hundred and fifty pounds, was in the
prime of life, vigorous and very stout. He was
it John Bell's a great deal, going as other friends
to relieve and comfort the family in their distress,
just as he would have attended a sick neighbor.
Mr. Miles had a lively experience with the witch,
which required more courage than force to meet.
He undertook to resist the playful frolics of the
intruder, which rather excited the animus of the
monster with resentment and pique for Miles,
and it manifested special delight in snatching
the cover from his bed and striking him heavy
blows. Mr. Miles said he exercised all the
strength in his arms in trying to retain the bed
covering when the witch was pulling at it, but in
vain; it was like tearing the whole fabric into
shreds. Mr. Featherston further states that the
-----File: 320.png---------------------------------------------------------
290 THE BELL WITCH.

witch sensation was the exciting theme of the
whole community when he moved in, and continued
so for vears. It was the subject of discussion
in every household, and is often talked of
now, having a bearing upon other things.

One of the most remarkable features in the
development of the witch character was its preeminent
Knowledge of men, an innate, tangible
comprehension of every man's attributes of mind
and nature. Every citizen ur stranger that came
in contact with the mystery found disparagement
in trying to cope with it on any subject, and
suffered an exposure of the inmost purposes and
secrets of the heart. Take for an example of its
exposition of this supernatural gift, the Johnson
brothers. There was no difference in their standing
as men of high honor and integrity of character.
John was perhaps considered the most
intellectual and forcible man of the two. while
Calvin was noted for his frankness, devotion to
principle. and absolute freedom from all deceit
and guile. These elements the witch observed,
and while it manifested the highest pleasure in
vociferating and palavering with John, it trusted
Calvin implicitly, and assigned its reagon for this
distinction. Calvin. it suid, was a pure, truthful,
scrupulous, Christian man, and therefore it gave
him its hand. which it refused John and every
one else. trusting no man as it did Calvin Johnson.
On the other hand it characterized John as
a sharp, unserupulous, tricky man, "whose Inmost
purpose was to catch it," and this, so far as the
witch was concerned, John admitted to be true,
-----File: 321.png---------------------------------------------------------
and that he had pursued unawares every scheme,
plan, stratagem, artifice or illusion he was capable
of inventing in his efforts to detect the autnor of
these most miraculous demonstrations, and at last
gave it up in despair, as a matter beyond human
power, knowledge or comprehension. This one
instance of distinguishing the difference in the
characters of the Johnson brvthers would not be
sufficient basis for a settled conclusion that the
so-called witch was an agency above human
genius or power, but the same wonderful intuition,
instinct and erchness was developed in hundreds
of instances, and was a leading characteristic
in all of its operations, and for this reason Mr.
Featherston says he cannot believe that the demonstrations
were the result of any human agency.

Dr, J. T. Mathews Testifies.

Dr. J. T. Mathews, who has been a well established
practicing physician of Cedar Hill for many
years, writes as follows:

Crepar Hitt, Teny., Dee. 23, 1891.

In answer to questions concerning the character
of certain gentlemen among the older settlers, it
gives me pleasure to testify to the high standing
and stability of character concerning Frank R.
Miles and W. B. Porter, whom I was personally
acquainted with, but too young to remember the
others. They were regarded as honorable gentlemen,
whose statements concerning any matter
were to be relied upon implicitly without the
least hesitation. They lived on Sturgeon Creek,

were of the best families in their day and time,

were known fur and near, and no one who knew

them would think of calling their veracity in

guestion. Respectfully, J.T. Matrurews.
E. Newton Knew the Men.

Mr. E. Newton, an old and respected citizen of
Cedar Hill, writes under date of Dec. 23, 1891:

I was personally acquainted with Rev. Thomas
Gunn, Rev. James Gunn, William Porter, John
Johnson, Calvin Johnson, Alexander Gunn, and
'the Bell family. They were of the best families
that ever lived in this country, men of the highest
integrity, and were honored by all people. They
were among the pioners of civilization and Christianity,
and were the leaders in the develupment
of the county. They molded the character of the
best element now in this section, and their influence
will live to affect generations to come. No
men contributed more to the advancement of
Christianity than the two Gunns, E. Newron.

A Host of Good Citizens Testify.

204 THE BELL WITCH.
Major Garaldus Pickering, the Man. Who Kicked the
Witch Out of Bed.

Mr. R. if. Pickering, an honored citizen of
Clarksville, Tenn., who has been connected with
the business interest of the city for forty years,
also served as County Trustee, and isa prominent
official in the Methodist Church, known throughout
the Tennessee Conference, contributes, the
statement of his father, Major Garaldus Pickering,
who was a distinguished citizen of his day,
and visited the Bell family during the witch
excitement. No testimony could be more reliable.
Mr. Henry Pickering states:

I have heard my father, Garaldus Pickering,
tell many wonderful things about the Bell Witch.
He taught a large school in the Beil vicinity for
a number of years, and educated two or three of
the Bell boys. He visited the family and had
some experience with the witch, as it was called,
though he did not believe in witchcraft, and said
he was never afraid of it. He had no idea as to
what it was, but certainly it was an insoluble
mystery, which has never been accounted for.
A great many people went to hear it talk and
witness its tricks; strangers came from North
Carolina, Virginia and other States, and it was
nothing uncommon to find the stables and lots
full of horses, and a horse tied in every corner of
the lane fence.

Father told me some remarkable experiences
which Frank Miles had with the witch, but I
will only repeat one or two things in his own
-----File: 325.png---------------------------------------------------------
personal experience and contact. He said: The
family and company had all retired for the night
in the usual way. Presently he felt the cover
slipping off toward the foot of the bed, and he
drew it up, holding it tightly. The next minute
he felt something like a hand or fingers tickling
him under the toes. He drew his feet up and
kicked with all the power in him. He felt something
weighty as his feet struck it, and heard it
strike against the wall and fall to the floor, making
a noise more like the falling of a side of heavy
sole leather, than anything he could describe.

Another instance; while the family and guests
were at supper, the subject of a wedding that was
to take place at that hour came up. Father
stated the names of the contracting parties, which
I have forgotten, but remember the circumstance
very distinctly, as it impressed me at the time.
However, some one remarked that the hour for
the marriage had about passed, and the parties
were no doubt then man and wife. Another
remarked that Rev. Gunn performed the ceremony.
The witch then spoke, exclaiming, "No,
he did not marry them." "Yes, but you are
mistaken this time," replied one. "Brother Gunn
was engaged to tic the knot, and he never fails."
"He failed this time," returned the witch.
"Brother Gunn was taken very sick and could
not go, and the wedding was about to be a failure,
but they sent off for Squire Byrns and he married
them." No one present believed it possible for
the witch to know the facts so soon, but this was
ascertained on the following day to be the truth
-----File: 326.png---------------------------------------------------------
238 THE BELL WITCH.
of the case in every particular. Regarding the
authorship of these very singular exhibitions,
father thought it absurd te charge it to any of
the Bell family. They were the sufferers, and
suffered greatly; morcever, they were every one
afraid of it; that was clear to any observer. He
was there one night when several strangers rode
up and halloed ever so long, and net one of the
family could be induced to go out, because they
were afraid, and be got out of bed, dressed, and
went out himself.
doh A, Guns Statement.

CLARKSVILLE, TENN., May 16, 1893,
To the Author--Dear Sir:

In reply to your questions T will state that I
am familar with the Bell Witch story as written
by Richard Williams Bell, and that I have beard
the same things that are detailed by him, and
many other incidents not recorded, repeated over
and again by the eld citizens who Hved in the
vicinity at that time. I have heard my father,
Alexander Gunn, John Johnson and Frank Miles
all repeat the circumstance of finding the vial of
poison in the cupboard at the time of John Bell's
death, the experiment in giving it toa cat, etc.,
just as told by the writer, all three being present
and witnessed Mr. Bell's death and the cireumstances.
I have heard Calvin Johnson tell the
circumstance of his shaking hands with the witch,
and many other very strange things. I have
heard my grandfathers, Rev. James Gunn and
-----File: 327.png---------------------------------------------------------
Rev. Thomas Gunn, repeat many of the demonstrations
which came under their observation;
also James Johnson related the same things; the
story of the witch bringing Mrs. Lucy Bell grapes
and hazelnuts. Mrs. Martha Bell, wife of Jesse
Bell, who lived to be ninety-six years of age, told-me
the story regarding the stockings as written
by Wilhams Beil. Aliso IT have heard William
Porter repeat the same circumstance of the witch's
visit to his house and getting in bed with him.
IT have heard Alex. Gooch and wife, who was
Theny Thorn, Jeif. and James Gooch, Jerry Baits,
Major Robert Bartlett, Prof John D. Tyler, of
Montgomery county, and many others who witnessed
the demonstrations, relate the same events
and discuss many other things chserved. [have
also talked with Mrs. Betsy Powell regarding her
troubles with the mysterious visitation. AH of
these people lived to a good old age, James Johnson
passed his ninety-ninth year, John Johnson
passed eighty, Grandfather Thomas Gunn ninety-six,
and Rev. James Gunn seventy years. They
were all honored citizens, whose statements were
trustworthy in regard to any matier, and no one
who ever knew them doubted the truth of the
circumstances regarding the witch demonstrations
at John Bell's and other places in the neighborhood..
Moreover, these citizens followed every
clue, exercised all of their wits, applied all manner
of tests, placed unsuspected detectives in and
around the house, acted upon all suggestiuns
regarding the suspicion that had been lodged
against certain members of the family, and with
-----File: 328.png---------------------------------------------------------

all, their investigations ended in confusion, leaving
the affair shrouded in still deeper mystery,
which no one to this day has ever been able to
account for or explain in any intelligent or satisfactory
way. Besides the names I have mentioned
among the most prominent citizens of the
community, hundreds of men from other communities
and seetions visited the place, remaining
days and nights, for the same purpose. and all
failed in the object of detecting the cause of the
demonstrations,

John Johnson, perhaps, took more interest in
the investigations than any other man; in fact,
from all I could gather. he was the leader and
inventor of most all the schemes resorted to. He
was a man of splendid endowments, keen observation,
quick perception, and close comprehension
; self-willed and self-possessed, sustaining an
unsullied and intrepid character, Moreover, he
was less given than most of men to the superstitious
ideas that characterized the people in that
age, and as he told me, he entered into the investigation
believing that some human agency was
at the bottom of the strange manifestations, and
he was determined to find it out if possible.

Knowing Mr. Johnson and others who lived
long years ago, as I did, together with the statements
of my father and grandfather, I cannot at
all question the appearance and existence of the
unsolved mystery of the Bell Witch, nor do I
doubt the actual occurrence of the incidents
recorded by Richard Williams Bell, whom I
knew to be one of the purest and best of men
-----File: 329.png---------------------------------------------------------
that ever lived in Robertson county.

Respectfully, Joun A. GUNN.
David Thompson Porter's Testimony.

Esquire Zopher Smith, a prominent Magistrate
of Clarksville, Tenn., was raised in Keysburg,
Ky., and gratefully remembers David Thompson
Porter as the friend of his youth. Mr. Porter
was a merchant of Keysburg, and was honored
for his worth as a citizen of the highest integrity
and force of character, enjoying at that day a
reputation similar to that sustained by his distinguished
son, Dr. D. T. Porter, of Memphis, Tenn.
Squire Smith was a young clerk in the store, and
he says he has heard Mr. Porter state repeatedly
that he spent many nights at John Bell's, acting
in concert with other citizens in trying to detect
the agency of those most mysterious and wonderful
demonstrations, following up every clue, and
exhausting all resources and stratagems to no
purpose. Squire Smith recounts many incidents
stated by Mr. Porter, which impressed him at the
time, especially the story of the witch carrying
hazelnuts and grapes to Mrs. Bell, which Mr.
Porter said was a positive fact. He described the
knocking at the door like some one seeking admittance,
and instantly the door would open of
its own accord, and then the witch would begin
talking. He also described the pulling of the
cover off of the beds, and nearly all of the characteristic
incidents recorded by Williams Bell, which
need not be repeated. Such statements as this
-----File: 330.png---------------------------------------------------------
300 THE BELL WITCH.

are of course hear-say, or second-handed testimony,
but nevertheless reliable. The writer has
several times observed Squire Smith as a witness
in a higher court, testifying to the preliminary
statements of certain witnesses in his court, which
was accepted as valid testimony, and this is just
the same kind of evidence. The men and women
of mature years who witnessed the demonstrations
have all passed away, but we have the ineidents
recorded by Williams Bell, and approved
by other members of the family, who were living
witnesses to all of it, and these hear-say statements
are simply repetitions of the same facts by
other parties who never saw Williams Bell's manuscript,
or knew that such a record was in existence,
and the chain of evidence is as complete and
strong as it is possible to make any kind of testimony.
Squire Smith says Mr. Porter affirmed
his statements with the same emphasis as if he
had been qualified in a court of justice, and he
could not disbelieve a word he said.

Dr, William Fort's Investigation.

The writer is authorized by a highly reputable
lady of the Fort connection to state that Dr. William
Fort came all the way from his home, then
in Missouri, to investigate the phenomena. Parties
who had failed in all of their efforts to explain
the mystery, gave publicity to the suspicion that
the demoustrations had their origin in the practice
of ventriloquism by certain members of the
family (something that would have been impos-*
-----File: 331.png---------------------------------------------------------
sible without the knowledge of the old people and
intimate neighbors, and without easy detection).
Dr. Fort determined to make a thorough test of
this version, and had the accused niembers to sit
by him, holding his hands over their mouths
while the witch continued to talk uninterrupted
and without change or modulation in the tone of
voice.

Private Conversation Exposed.

The same lady relates this incident: Jesse
Herring and wife were two estimable old people
who lived in the vicinity. They were extremely
cautious and guarded in their conversation about
other people, and never discussed the witch or
spent any opinion about it, away from their own
fireside. One nignt with closed doors, and not a
soul in the house except themselves, they discussed
the mystery very freely, and not a word
was spoken by either of them to any one in regard
to this conversation, or the witch. On the following
night the witch reported the whole conversation
to the company assembled at John Pell's.

Emptied the Milk Vessels,

Mrs. Betsy Sugg called one morning to pay
Mrs. Lucy Bell a visit. The subject of milk and
butter.came up, and Mrs, Bell spoke of her new
dairy house and invited Mrs. Sugg out to show
her how nicely it was arranged. She had just
finished straining and setting the milk for cream,
locked the door and put the key in her pocket.
-----File: 332.png---------------------------------------------------------
302 THE BELL WITCH.
The milk was set in pewter basins, vessels then
in common use for milk, with wooden covers.
Mrs. Bell took the key from her pocket, unlocked
and opened the door, and to her surprise and
chagrin there was not a. drop of milk there, and
the basins were turned bottom up and the covers
placed over them. "Some of Kate's mischief,"
exclaimed Mrs. Bell. "The witch is always playing
some such prank as this."

Uncle to the Devil.

The witch it is said always treated the preachers,
the Gunns and Rev. Sugg Fort, with more respectful
consideration than other people. It was
inclined to be on intimate or jocular terms with
Rev. Fort, calling him Uncle Suggie, always welcoming
him at the door with a happy salutation,
"Good morning," or "Good evening Uncle Suggie.
How do you like to be called uncle to the devil?"

Frightened Jerry Stark's Horse.

Mr. James Chapman, a good citizen of Keysburg,
Ky., spent the prime of his life in Robertson
county, and repeats many of the incidents herein
noted, as he heard them stated by older citizens.
He heard more from Jerry Stark than any other
person, and says, knowing the upright character
of the man, he could not question Mr. Stark's
statements. Mr. Stark visited the Bell place frequently
during the witch excitement, and the
-----File: 333.png---------------------------------------------------------
progress of the investigations, and generally
stayed all night.

Mr. Stark, says Chapman, described a large tree
that stood in the Bell lane, under which he had
to pass, when leaving the place the following
morning, after staying over night, and invariably,
as he approached near, a rustling sound was
heard among the leaves of the tree, and immediately
as he passed under the tree, something
apparently the size of a rabbit would jump out
of the tree behind him, and that instant his horse
would dash off as fast as he could go, which Mr.
Stark said he could not account for, and never
saw anything more of the spectre after it jumped.
Mr. Chapman further states that some time after
the old Bell house had been torn away, he was
there helping Williams Bellin the wheat harvest.
The grain was very rank, and they had stopped
under a pear tree to whet their scythes and rest,
and while there he mentioned this circumstance
as told him by Mr. Jerry Stark, and Williams
Bell confirmed the statement, pointing to the tree
which was still standing, remarking that Stark's
horse always started in wu run with him the
moment he passed under that tree.

Esqure James I. Holman Writes.
SPRINGFIELD, TENN., Nov. 4, 1893.
AMV. Ingram--My Dear Sir:

I see in the Nashville Banner of November 3d,
a statement to the effect that you are writing a
history of the Bell Witch for publication, and I
write you to say that I want a copy as soon as it
-----File: 334.png---------------------------------------------------------
304 THE BELL WITCH.
is out. I am now fifty-one years of age, and
have as keen a relish for reading the full details
of the great mystery as I did when a boy, and
heard my grandfather, Irvin Polk, tell so much
of the many wonderful things he had witnessed,
known as the witch demonstrations. He lived
near the Bell place, and was there on many occasions
and witnessed strange things that he could
in no way account for, and which, as I understand,
has never been explained. I could not
doubt the statements of grandfather, even had I
never heard them confirmed by many others, and
it certainly was a wonderfully mysterious thing.
The old Bell house in which the witch performed,
if you do not know the fact, was many years ago
torn down and moved to the place on the bluff
of Brown's ford, now occupied by Levi Smith
and family. I learn from my father, Col. D. D.
Holman, that Major Wash. Lowe, who you remember
as a prominent lawyer of Springfield,
undertook to write up the facts, but for some
reason never finished, and turned his writing
over to Allen Bell, which you may get and learn
something from. Respectfully, your friend.
James I. Hotman.
The writer will state that he has all the notes
written by Major Lowe, but it is so badly faded
and colorless that very little of it is legible.
William Wall's Expertence With the Witch.
Esquire J. E. Ransdell, of the Fourteenth District
of Montgomery county, Tenn., relates the
-----File: 335.png---------------------------------------------------------
experience of Uncle Billy Wall with the witch, as
he heard the old gentleman tell it to many persons.
Mr. Wall lived at Fredonia, in Montgomery
county. He has been dead some ten years, but
his story impressed Squire Ransdell in such a
way that he has never forgotten it. Uncle Billy
said he concluded to go over to Bell's and hear
the mysterious talking that was exciting the
country. He started late, on a good fat horse,
that was remarkable for its good saddle qualities
and gentleness. Nearing the place he was hailed
by a voice in the bushes calling him familiarly,
"Hello, Billy Wall, you are going to see the
witch?" '"Yes," replied Uncle Billy, "that is
where I am going." The voice replied, "I am
going there too, and believe I will ride behind
you on that fat horse." 'All right," returned
Mr. Wall, "hop up." That moment he felt his
horse squat, as if some heavy weight had fallen
upon him, and then commenced wriggling, prancing
and kicking up. He threw one hand behind
to feel what it was, and then the other hand, but
found nothing, and yet, he said, "the dain
thing kept up a continual palavering at my back,
asking me all sorts of hell-fired questions, while
my horse continued in a canter, squealing and
kicking up, and every damn hair on my head
stood straight up, reaching for the treetops. It
wan't no fun for me, but the damn thing kept
on laughing and talking about my fine race horse,
and how pleasant it was to ride behind on his
broad fat back, telling me what a fine suit of hair
T had, and how beautifully it stood up, making
-----File: 336.png---------------------------------------------------------
306 THE BELL WITCH.
me lovk like a statesman. I let my horse out,
and wan't long in getting there. As soon as I
halted in front of the house, the damn thing
politely invited me to "light Mr. Wall, hitch
your horse to the rack and go in; I will be in
pretty soon and entertain you.' Just about an
hour later the racket commenced, and it looked
like hell was to pay. It came rattling like dried
hazelnuts pouring down by showers on the floor,
and all sorts of talking going on. That trip satisfied
me; I got enough of the witch in one night
and never went back." Squire Ransdell says the
way in which Mr. Wall told this story, giving
emphasis to nearly every word, portraying in expression
his own feelings at the time, was the
most laughable thing he ever heard.
Joshua Gardner Testified to the Wonderful Phenomena.

Among the many letters in answer to the advertisement
for the Bell Witch, after it went into
the hands of the publisher, the following from
from W. H. Gardner, a prominent business man
of Union City, Tenn., and A. E. Gardner, of
Dresden, Tenn., a gentleman favorably known
throughout the State for his high integrity, presents
evidence regarding Joshua Gardner's experience
with the witch demonstrations:

Union City, Tenn., April 20, 1894.

M. V. Ingram--Lear Sir:

When will your book, "History of the Bell
Witch," be out? My uncle, Joshua Gardner, was
a conspicuous figure in the remarkable affair, as
-----File: 337.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WITCH. Ed
Betsy Bell's lover, and of course I want to read
your history. Truly, as you say, it is the most
wonderful phenomenon that ever occurred in this
or any other country, and which will no doubt
ever remain a mystery. I can recall, perhaps, an
hundred occasions since I was a boy that I heard
Uncle Joshua relating the remarkable story, and
strange to say, in the latter years of his life, he
was loth to speak of it, even when urged to recount
the queer doings and sayings of the witch,
and then, if one of his hearers manifested the
least inclination to disbelieve, he would desist.
He believed in it as strong as he held to his religion,
and a more devoted conscientious Christian
man never lived than Joshua Gardner. He died
a few years since at the age of eighty-four years.
I remember that Uncle Joshua received a copy of
the Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post of 1849,
containing a long and interesting account of the
witch, written by a reporter. We kept.the paper
until a few years since, but it has in some way
been lost and cannot now be found. I understand
that Mrs. Wade, living near here, who is
now ninety years of age, was a witness to the
stirring and exciting incidents. There are several
persons in this vicinity who are familiar with the
history of the witch, and agree perfectly as to the
facts of the remarkable phenomenon.
Respectfully, W. H. GARDNER.
Drespen, TENN., April 25, 1894.

LATEST DEMONSTRATIONS.
CHAPTER XV.
The Witch's Return After Seren Years.

Williams Bell says when the witch took its
departure in 1821, biddiug adieu to the family,
it promised to return in seven years. He also
records the fact that it did return according to
promise, remaining some two weeks. making the
same demonstrations that characterized the first
appeariog, and that himself, Joel Bell and their
mother, Mrs. Lucy Bell, were the only members
of the family then remaining at the old homestead--John,
Drew and Betsy, those accused of
producing the demonstrations, having all gone
away to themselves, and were not apprised of the
re-appearance, the three having agreed to keep
the matter a profound secret, lest the old troubles
should be renewed. This statement is substantiated
by Joel, who in later years never hesitated
to talk about the family troubles, detailing the
circumstances to interesred friends inquiring into

the mystery. He consulted with his brother in
regard to the publication, read his manuscript,
and knew everything that was in it. Williams
Bell, however, does not vouch for the many reports
of strange noises and varied sounds, and
mysterious appearances, seen and heard about
the place and at several other places in that end
of the county, to which others testify; much of
the testimony to these apparitions has been
omitted. He heard no more of it up to the
date of his writing, 1846. Later than this, however,
there is some well substantiated evidence to
demonstrations similar to the early manifestations.

After the death of Mrs. Lucy Bell, the land was
divided, and Joel heired the river plot, adjoining
Williams on the north, on which he settled after
his marriage.

Dr. Henry H. Sugg's Statement
is first of importance, which the writer is authorized
to repeat by three highly creditable persons,
one a lady, and the others, Col. Thomas Trigg,
of Montgomery county, Tenn., and Mr. John A.
Gunn, to whom he made the statement at different
times, and all repeat it precisely alike; also
Col. Yancey narrates the same story. Dr. Sugg
said he was called to Joel Bell's to see a sick
child. This was about 1852. It was a cold day,
and entering the house 'as usual he found a comfortable
fire burning, and placing his medical
pocket on the floor by the door as he entered, he
seated himself by the fire to. warm. Immediately
-----File: 342.png---------------------------------------------------------
310 THE BELL WITCH.
he heard a rapping or rattling of glass in the
valise, and instantly following this was an explosive
sound like the popping of corks, and a crash
of the vials. He was sure that every bottle in
the valise had been smashed, and he jumped up
excitedly to ascertain the cause, but on opening
the valise, found nothing out of place and no
harm done. Mr. Bell also observed the same
thing, and remarked that such things were common,
that he never paid any attention to them.
This statement is further supported and given
additional significance by

Reynolds Powell's Story
of a cirecumsrance which occurred at the same
place in 1861.

Joel Bell sold this farm to his bruther Williams,
and after the death of Williams Bell, the
place was allotted to his son, Allen Bell, who
cultivated it several years before he was married.

'The writer visited Mrs. Annie Powell, a daughter
of the late Dr. Scott, of Barren Plains, Robertson
county, and widow of DeWitt Powell, who
now resides near Barren Plains, for the purpose
of interviewing her on the subject in hand. We
found her quite an interesting lady, familiar
with the entire history of the Bell Witch, as she
had heard it repeated by her father and mother,
and mother-in-law, the Gunn family, and many
others, rehearsing, as she did, many of the circumstances
already recorded, remarking in the
conversation, "Allen Bell could tell you a very
-----File: 343.png---------------------------------------------------------
THE BELL WITCH. 3t1
interesting circumstance if he would, but I have
no idea that he will, as he has never spoken of it
to any of us. Reynolds Powell, however, told all
about the affair the next day after it happened.
Allen Bell had about recovered from a hard spell
of sickness. In fact he was discharged from the
army soon after he joined on account of bad health,
from which he was not expected to recover.
Reynolds Powell went down to spend a night
with him during his convalesence, and on_ his
return home next morning he told how bad he
and Allen were scared. Allen had been staying
with his step-mother, but other company came
in, and they went over to Allen's place to sleep,
in order to make roum. They retired, leaving
the doors open for fresh air, and very soon, he
said, the dog commenced barking furiously, and
ran into the house greatly frightened, while a
strange noise was heard without. The dog continued
snarling, snapping and barking in a frightened
way that indicated a close contest with
something. They got up to see what was the
matter, but could not discover anything unusual
and put the dog out, closing the doors. The dog
took to his feet and left the place, and all was
quiet for the next hour, when they were awakened
by the removal of the bolster from under
their heads, and then followed the sheets, being
jerked from under them. They arose to investigate
the causé, but could find nothing out of the
regular order of things. They replaced the sheet
and bolster, securely bolted the doors, and retired
again, placing a light cover over-them. After
-----File: 344.png---------------------------------------------------------
312 THE BELL WITCH.

some while the same trick was repeated, the cover
bolster and sheet all being snatched from the bed.
They replaced the things, which were removed
the third time. They then placed the bolster on
the bed, and laid with their breasts across it,
holding with their hands, determined to retain
it, but it was immediately snatched away with
great force, and the bolster was thrown on top of
their heads, and this ended the contest. He said
they did not sleep much, and I suppose that was
true. You ask Allen about it."

Reynolds Powell was killed in the Confederate
army after this. The writer interviewed Allen
Bell in regard to the circumstance, and he admitted
that it was substantially. true, but he was
surprised to learn that Reynolds Powell had ever
told it to any one. He said, however, that the
demonstrations were never repeated while he
remained on the place. This.demonstration was
characteristic of the performances at John Bell's,
and was evidently the acts of the same agency.

Another characteristic incident in the same
vicinity, or on the Bell place, several years later,
to which reputable gentlemen testifies, is here
presented.

Music of the Enchanted Spring.

John A. Gunn and A. L. Bartlett testify that
during the year 1866 they had occasion to cross
Red River, and the stream having swollen too full
for fording, they left their horses on the south, or
Bell side of the river, and crossed over in a canoe.
Returning late in the afternoon, they landed near
-----File: 345.png---------------------------------------------------------
the famous enchanted spring, designated by the
spirit as the hiding place of the treasure-trove.
They did not land there, however, with any
expectation of finding the treasure, oh no. They
sought a cooling draught of limpid water to
quench their burning thirst, so they say, which
is evidently true. However, after refreshing
themselves, they started up the hill, when a sweet
strain of music pierced their ears like a volume
of symphony vibrating the air. They both involuntarily
stopped, and seated themselves on a
moss covered stone, listening to the ravishing
melody which continued some thirty minutes.
It was unlike any music they had ever heard.
The modulating sound was indescribable, and
unsurpassingly sweet. It was utterly impossible
to discover from whence it came, the whole atmosphere
seemed thrilled with vibrating euphony,
and the gentlemen were caught up, as it were, on
wings of ecstacy.

Heartless people who have no conception of
the nysterious, no ear for music, no eye for the
beautiful, and no taste for the sweets of this life,
ascribe such manifestations as this to the imagination
under a peculiar state of mind, and bewildering
circumstances. But not so in this case.
These gentlemen were then in the vigor of young
manhood, and had crossed the river that day in
defiance of wind and wave to spend a joyous
Sabbath with their best girls. Evidently they
did not return with their hearts attuned to a
heavenly sonnet, for neither of them married on
on the north side of the river, nor did they ever

cross again on the same mission, and therefore
could not have experienced the passionate throbbings
that calls forth such an euphonious dulcet.

The writer can bear testimony to some remarkable
experiences in crossing the same stream
near the charmed spring, and it is under altogether
different circumstances and state of mind
that one's imaginations take flight, catching
sweet intonations froim the rippling waves, and
chasing billows, bringing the cadence into diapason
with the melody of the birds and the chant
of the sylph, forming a transporting consonance
that carries the soul beyond that blessed abode
where the ordinary mortal is willing to stop.
These gentlemen had no such experience; in
truth they sought a draught of lethe in all possible
haste--a spring known to all lovers of that
section as the gushing stream of oblivion, and he
who drinks may depart in forgetfulness. Kate,
the spirit, is ever present to administer to the
comfort of a despairing swain. There was no
circumstance attending this incident that could
have possibly exercised the imagination. The
gentlemen were tired and had no imagination,
and there could not have been any illusion or
delusion in the melodious sound that pierced
their ears. It was no other than Kate, the witch,
who always put in just at the right time and
place unexpectedly and most mysteriously, and
no doubt that that the sweet strains of music was
very helpful to their fatigued feelings.

Be this as it may, they are men of veracity and
testify to the truth of this incident. They were

then fresh from the field of battle, familiar with
the sound of rattling musketry and roaring cannon,
and were not easily frightened or deceived.
Kate was a musical witch, and the circumstance
is characteristic of the acts performed years before.

The writer has information of two incidents
which occurred in 1872, a few miles from the
Bell place, that were of the same nature and
character of the disturbances thatannoyed the Bell
family so much, and unmistakably eminated
from the same source or agency. These demonstrations
were witnessed by two young ladies who
could not have been mistaken. But, for proper
and prudent reasons, they request that the circumstances
and details be omitted in this publication,
and in deference to their wishes they are
not recorded. However, these incidents are
sufficient to enable the autnor to trace the operations
of the agency known as the "Bell Witch"
from 1817 to 1872, a period of fifty-five years, and
he leaves readers to form their own conclusion as
to the nature and authorship of the demonstrations.
The testimony presented is given on the
authority and statements of the very best people
of the country, men and women who would not
lend their names and influence for the purpose
of making up a story of fiction, and altogether
goes to establish beyond question or doubt the
existence for fifty-five years of the greatest mystery
and wonder that the world has any account
of. The writer has only to say in conclusion,
that if it was the work of human agency, the

autnor was a shrewd devil, of great age and wonderful
cunning, to have escaped detection during
so long a reign, terrorizing the fears of timid people,
continuing still at large undiscovered and
unknown, in a country of sharp detectives, set to
catch evil doers of every description. Conceding
that it is possible for a person or persons, through
any kind of mechanism, skill or human genius,
to inaugurate such a mystifying terror, continuing
over a half century undiscovered, is to admit
that the present century of Christian civilization
has progressed far beyond any other age in developing
deviltry in human nature.
