THE BELL WITCH. 145
said to a coterie of gentlemen who were discussing
the witch, that he was convinced that the whole
thing was a family affair, an invention gotten up
for a sensation to draw people and make money,
and the actors were afraid to make any demon-
strations while he was present, knowing his pro-
fession and business, and that he would most
assuredly expose the trick. One of the gentlemen
told father what Williams had said, and it made
him very indignant. He felt outraged that such
a charge should be made without the evidence,
by a man professing to be a gentleman, to whom
he had extended every courtesy and hospitality,
and had proffered any assistance he might call
for, and .in a rage he threatened to order Williams
from the place immediately. Just at this junc-
ture Kate spoke, “No you don’t, old Jack, let
him stay; I will attend to the gentleman and
satisfy him that he is not so smart as he thinks.”
Father said no more, nor did he take any action
in the matter, but treated Mr. Williams gentle-
manly as he did others, nor was anything more
heard from Kate. The house was crowded with
visitors that night, all expectantly and anxious
to hear the witch talk, and sat till late bed time
awaiting the sound of the mystifying voice, but
not a word or single demonstration of any kind
