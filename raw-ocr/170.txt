ister to mother’s wants, and it was utterly impos-
sible to distinguish from whence it came, and yet
so pathetic as to affect the sympathy of everyone
who came within hearing. It was noticeable also
that Kate kept quiet when mother was apparently
at rest or sleeping. She rested better in the latter
part of the night, and was somewhat refreshed
for the m :rning, and as soon as she was aroused
Kate was heard inquiting, “How do you feel this
morning, Luce? Did you rest well through the
night? Don’t you want to hear a song, Luce?”
Mother was very fond of vocal music, in which
Kate excelled, and it was her pleasure to reply,
“Yes Kate, sing something sweet.” While the
witch sung a number of beautiful stanzas, the
following was the favorite, which was sung every
day:
Come my heart and let us try
For a little season
Every burden to lay by
Come and let us reason.
What is this that casts you down?
Who are those that grieve you?
Speak and let the worst be known,
Speaking may relieve you.
Christ by faith IT sometimes see
And He doth relieve me,
