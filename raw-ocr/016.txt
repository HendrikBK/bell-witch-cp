Hon. J. Allen Bell, Adairville, Ky:

Dear Sir—In reply to your favor of the Ist
inst., I remember distinctly the discussion be-
tween Mr. Joel E. Bell and myself in 1867, in
regard to the publication of the history of the
Bell Witch, and also his after report of the inter-
view with you, which eaused the matter to be
dropped. Joel Bell was a gentleman whom I
esteemed very highly for his moral worth and
generous friendship. His earnestness impressed
me with the views so decidedly expressed in favor
of the publication then, believing the facts would
correct the erroneous impressions which had been
created. I will accept your proposition and
undertake to compile such testimony as may still
exist, as you suggest, and will endeavor to make
a faithful record of the facts. I have always
regarded the so-called Bell Witch as a phenom-
enon for which the Bell family, who suffered the
infliction and misfortune, could in no wise be
responsible, but were entitled to all of that sym-
pathy so generously bestowed by the good people
