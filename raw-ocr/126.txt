116 THE BELL WITCH.

contained some relics which Indians commonly
buried with their dead, and proposed to open one
and see, to which Drew agreed, and they pro-
ceeded to disinter the bones. Finding nothing
else, Hall brought the jawbone to the house, and
while sitting in the passage he threw it against
the opposite wall, and the jarring knocked out a
loose tooth, which dropped through a crack in
the floor.

Father pasred through the hall in the mean-
while, and reprimanded the boys severely
for their action, and made one of the negro men
take the jawbone back, replacing all the disin-
terred bones, aud filling in the grave. This was
evidently the circumstance referred to by the
“spirit,” so long forgotten, and to be reminded of
the fact so mysteriously was very: perplexing,
and troubled father no little. He examined the
floor just where the bone dropped when it struck
the wall, as the boys had left it, and there was
the crack referred to, and he was pestered, and
decided to take up a portion of the floor and see
if the tooth could be found. The dirt under-
neath was raked up, sifted and thoroughly exam-
ined, but the tooth was not found. The witch
then laughed at father, declaring that it was all
a joke to fool “Old Jack.”
