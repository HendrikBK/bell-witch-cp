176 THE BELL WITCH.

return, and along toward the last I stayed with
him all the time, especially when he left the
house, going with him wherever he went. The
witch also grew more angry and virulent in dis-
position. Every word uttered to “Old Jack” was
a blast of curses and heinous threats, while to
mother, “Old Luce,” it continued most tender,
loving and kind. About the middle of October
father had a very severe attack, which kept him
confined to the house six or eight days. The
witch cursed and raved like a maniac for several
days, and ceased not from troubling him. How-
ever, he temporarily overcome this attack, and
was soon able to be out, though he would not
venture far from the house. But it was not des-
tined that he should enjoy a long respite. After
a week’s recuperation he felt much stronger, and
called me very early one morning to go with him
to the hog pen, some three hundred yards from
the house, for the purpose of giving directions in
separating the porkers intended for fattening
from the stock hogs, We had not gone far before
one of his shoes was jerked off. I replaced it on
his foot, drawing the strings tight, tying a double
hard knot. After going a few steps farther, the
other shoe flew off in the same manner, which
was replaced and tied as in the case of the first.
