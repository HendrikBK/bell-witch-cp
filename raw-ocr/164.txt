as the teacher could get there, a little after sun-
rise, and dismiss about thirty minutes before
sunset. Our route was through the woods, and
some briar patches and hazel thickets by the way-
side. Passing these thickets, returning home,
sticks of wood and rocks were often tossed at us,
but never with much force, and we soon learned

back into the thicket from whence they came,

everything that occurred along the way. Even
if one of us stumped a toe, falling over, the witch
claimed to have caused it, and would describe
how it appeared in the form of a rabbit or some-
thing else at certain places. Our most serious
trouble, however, was experienced at home, the

twisting our hair, and it was hard for a tired
