whack, and the oracle tumbled over like lightning
had struck him, but he quickly recovered his feet
and went capering around the room like a fright-
ened steer, running over every one in his way,
yelling, “Oh my none, my nose, the devil has got
me. Oh lordy, he’s got me by the nose.” Sud-
denly, as if by its own accord, the door flew open
and the witch layer dashed out, and made a bee
line for the lane at full speed, yelling every jump.
Everybody rushed out under the excitement,
expecting the man would be kuled, but as far as
they could hear up the lane, he was still running
and yelling, ©Oh Lordy.” Jackson, they say,
dropped down on the ground and rolled over and
over, laughing. “By the eternal, boys, I never
saw so much fun in all my Hfe. This beats fight-
ing the British.” Presently the witch was on
hand and joined in the laugh. “Lerd Jesus,” it
exclaimed, “Ifow the old devil did run and beg;
Vl bet he wont come here again with his old
horse pistol to shoot me. I guess that’s fun
cnough for to-night, General, and you can go to
bed now. T will come to-morrow night and show
you another rascal in this crowd.” Old Hickory
was anxious to stay a week, but his party had
enough of that thing. No one knew who’s turn
would come next, and no inducements could
keopthem. They spent the next night in Sprirg-
field, and returned to Nashville the tollowing day.

Tiere was much talk about the witch shaking
hands with one of the Johnson’s, a near neighbor,
and Patrick MeGowin, a highly esteemed Irish-
man, who lived across the line in Montgomery
