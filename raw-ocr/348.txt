316 THE BELL WITCH.

author was a shrewd devil, of great age and won-
derful cunning, to have escaped detection during
so long a reign, terrorizing the fears of timid peo-
ple, continuing still at large undiscovered and
unknown, in a country of sharp detectives, set to
catch evil doers of every description. Conceding
that it is possible for a person or persons, through
any kind of mechanism, skill or human genius,
to inaugurate such a mystifying terror, continu-
ing over a half century undiscovered, is to admit
that the present century of Christian civilization
has progressed far beyond any other age in devel-
oping deviltry in human nature.
