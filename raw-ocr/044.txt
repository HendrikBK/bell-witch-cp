40 THE BELL WITCH.

River. Each one of the partners would take
charge of a boat as captain or master, and first
loaded, first off. After arriving at New Orleans,
and selling the cargo, the boats were worthless
except for fuel or second-hand lumber, and they
were sold for what the timber would bring, and
the boatmen made their way home as best they
could, generally walking, and arriving in time to
build more boats for the next season. A bill of
lading for the last one of these trips, still in exist-
ence, was made out to’ Alex. Gunn, April, 1818,
for fitty hogsheads of tobacco weighing 64,166
pounds gross, probably not over 52,000 pounds
net. every hogshead rumbered, for which he
brought in returns a draft on a Nashville bank
for $1,000, two hundred pairs of boots, $800, and
$211 in sugarand coffee. This was probably after
paying freight charges, about three cents per
pound, for the tobacco. About this time two
steainboats, the General Green and the General
Robertson, entered the Cumberland River, driv-
ing most of the flat-boatsmen out of the business,
having a monopoly of the shipping trade up to
1822, making Clarksville the principal shipping
point, which was then a town of only forty fami-
Nes-—215 white population, and a number of ne-
grocs.
