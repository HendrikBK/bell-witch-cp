268 THE BELL WITCH.

“Bennett, didn’t you see the biggest and poorest
old rabbit that you ever saw in your life, as you
came on here this evening?” “Yes,” replied: Mr,
Porter. ‘Well that was me,” said the witch, and
then bursted into laughter. This was the kind
of gossip it carried on constantly, and would tell
what different people in the neighborhood had
been doing during the day, or what was then
transpiring.

It seemed to take speciai delight in afflicting
and tormenting ofd Mr. Bell, and his young
daughter Betsy. It often said that it had cone
to kill old Jack Pall, and it was said that Mr.
Bell died from strange aficiions visited on him
by his tormentor. fcinterfersd a great deal with
Betsy's love affairs. and) wanted her to marry’a
certain man in the neighborhood. Betsy com-
plained of a painful sensation like some one
sticking pins in her body. Tt would fill her hair
full of pins, jerk her thexing comb ont. and laugh
at its own wieked tricks and Hetsv's discom fiture,
and she was frequently sent fron home for rest
and freedom front the tortures inflieted by the
witeh,

Tt wax very conmion fer Jarge crowds to gather
at Mr. Bell’s to hear the witch talk. One night
when the house was full, there came an old gen-
tleman by the name of Grizzard. The witeb
entered with the exclamation, “Here is old Griz-
gard; you all just ought to hear old Grizzard call
his hogs. He begins, ‘Pig, pig, pig.” The hogs
come in a run, and Griz counts them and. then
begins hollering, ‘Here, here, sic, sic, sowey, sowey.’
