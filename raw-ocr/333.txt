THE BELL WITCH. 303
progress of the investigations, and generally
stayed all night.

Mr. Stark, says Chapman, described a large tree
that stood in the Bell lane, under which he had
to pass, when leaving the place the following
morning, after staying over night, and invariably,
as he approached near, a rustling sound was
heard among the leaves of the tree, and immedi-
ately as he passed under the tree, something
apparently the size of a rabbit would jump out
of the tree behind him, and that instant his horse
would dash off as fast as he could go, which Mr.
Stark said he could not account for, and never
saw anything more of the spectre after it jumped.
Mr. Chapman further states that some time after
the old Bell house had been torn away, he was
there helping Williams Bellin the wheat harvest.
The grain was very rank, and they had stopped
under a pear tree to whet their scythes and rest,
and while there he mentioned this circumstance
as told him by Mr. Jerry Stark, and Williams
Bell confirmed the statement, pointing to the tree
which was still standing, remarking that Stark’s
horse always started in wu run with him the
moment he passed under that tree.
