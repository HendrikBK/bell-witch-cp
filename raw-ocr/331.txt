Herring and wife were two estimable old people
who lived in the vicinity. They were extremely
cautious and guarded in their conversation about
other people, and never discussed the witch or

fireside. One nignt with closed doors, and not a
soul in the house except themselves, they dis-
cussed the mystery very freely, and not a word
was spoken by either of them to any one in regard
to this conversation, or the witch. On the follow-
ing night the witch reported the whole conversa-
tion to the company assembled at John Pell’s.
